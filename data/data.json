        "content": "\n<p>Something that I’ve recently been thinking about is the pressure we put on ourselves. As someone obsessed with self-help, it’s important to look at if self-care and self-motivation is actually helping. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always been someone who puts a lot of pressure on myself. Even from a young age, I was a perfectionist. If I couldn’t do a task to an incredibly high standard, then there was no point in doing it at all. This, as I have gotten older, I have realised is not helpful or healthy. At this point in my life, I don’t strive for every workout at the gym to be the best of my ability, or always improve every time I go. I focus on consistency. I am proud of myself for simply turning up (and trying my best). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure of results is something I have also removed in this area of my life, I don’t expect immense changes in my body straight away. I know with time, the results will come, as long as I keep at it and stop focusing only on the changes in my body. Truthfully, in other parts of my life, I am still working on this. Learning to enjoy the journey as much as the results, whatever they may be, is so important. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure of knowing what you want is another obstacle. I feel like trying to figure out who you are and what is you, takes time and takes you unlearning the need to be liked by everyone. This does take time. It takes a lot of investing in yourself and trusting in yourself. It isn’t something I believe comes overnight for anyone but it is so important for your happiness and growth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure we put on ourselves every day is sometimes needed, but when this pressure holds us back and makes us question ourselves, it can be debilitating. I am still on a journey to find the right balance for me but right now I choose to set myself free from any pressure so I can be the best me in the right now. </p>\n",

Please feel free to comment because I know there are others that could benefit from hearing your voice as well. I would be thrilled if we could be on this journey together. I started this blog about 60 days in the challenge, so there’s plenty of time for us to be goal friends. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sprint 9 – February 10, 2022- February 24, 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 119</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s inspiration was about celebrating the changes I’ve made. Many people fantasize about hitting rock bottom as the nidus for change. However, changing habits happens by changing habits. Over the last 119 days, I haven’t had a drink because I changed my relationship with alcohol through habit change. My autopilot is changing from getting a drink to passing on alcohol. I’m very happy with my changes because there are always reasons to have a drink and fall into old habits. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Day120</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s inspiration was about examining why I don’t do the things I know will make a difference in my life. Most of our inaction is driven by wanting to know how. Many of us know how, but we rather fight it. Change takes action; continued and intentional action. One of my goals is establishing a meditation practice. I can’t understand why I haven’t been meditating. Luckily, today’s inspiration urged me to take action today. Therefore, I will meditate today. No excuses. I’m going to break that cycle and take action. Who knows… It might be the first day of a lifelong practice and journey. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 121</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s inspiration was about reflecting on what alcohol really is. In the inspiration they referenced a definition from Google. Merriam-Webster defines alcohol as “ethanol especially when considered as the intoxicating agent in fermented and distilled liquors”. Ethanol is defined as “a colorless volatile flammable liquid C2H5OH that is the intoxicating agent in liquors and is also used as a solvent and in fuel” Reading that definition definitely makes alcohol less appealing. They might as well say it’s a poison with intoxicating effects. I took this inspiration a step further and looked up the safety data sheet for ethanol. A safety data sheet outlines the occupational safety and health cautions for various substances. The safety data sheet for ethanol has the following hazard statements:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Highly  flammable  liquid  and  vapor </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Causes  serious  eye  irritation </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suspected  of  causing  cancer </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suspected  of  damaging  fertility  or  the  unborn  child</p>\n\n\n\n<p>May  cause  damage  to  organs </p>\n\n\n\n<p>May  cause  drowsiness  or  dizziness</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The signal word for ethanol is Danger. It’s so interesting that over time me and most people have learned of the risks and dangers of this substance, but still chose to partake. Looking at these facts concretely reinforces my desire to keep ethanol out of my body. Whether we call it alcohol, a shot, boose, nightcap, or a drink, that doesn’t change that we’re talking about a dangerous and toxic substance. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 122</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s inspiration was about the impact of every action. Over time, any repeated action could become a habit. Positively, starting a healthy lifestyle can stick, the more we act on it. Conversely, repeated negative actions can stick as well. This inspiration made me better appreciate the impact every action has. As much as I’ve been reluctant to meditation, every meditation I do, gets me closer to it becoming a habit. This challenge is also an excellent example. It’s now a habit for me to avoid alcohol and ask for non-alcoholic options. Seeing this change really makes meditation and other positive habits seem like a cake walk. It’s so encouraging and intriguing to know that everything I do makes a difference now and in the future through habits. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 123</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s inspiration was about reflecting on the quote, “How can I fly like an eagle when I’m surrounded by turkeys?” This quote emphasizes how important it is to surround yourself with the right type of people as you try to accomplish your goals. Over the years, I’ve had to prune or fall out of contact with a lot of people. We couldn’t grow into the people we were becoming being in each other’s lives, for better or worst. I currently feel I have a good group of people in my life to motivate and uplift me. However, I’m encouraged to seek out more like-minded and inspirational associates as I grow into this better version of myself. The comforting part is that this is now possible with the use of online forums and groups. I’ve found that my various “tribes” and “families” have been invaluable as I’ve tried to implement change in my life. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 124</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s inspiration was about changing routines. I was encouraged to be mindful of the habit loop ( Trigger> Routine> Reward). I was encouraged to keep the reward and trigger, but replace the routine with a healthier option. Alcohol doesn’t seem to be an active issue to brainstorm this with, but I continue to struggle with food. I’m not gaining enormous amounts of weight, but I know could change the habits I have around food. I believe my bad habits around eating start at what I buy. The trigger in this scenario would be needing to get groceries. My routine is to go through every aisle. No matter what I get, the reward is food for the week. I can flip out my routine by going to the perimeter aisles with all the fresh food and reserve the middle aisle in the event I need something for a recipe or ran out of a kitchen staple. This will not only promote healthy eating for myself, but the for the entire family. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 125</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s inspiration encouraged me to list 3 good things. I like this activity because it’s simple and still invokes gratitude without much thought. I also like it because the 3 things can be anything. This is great because it keeps me positive about the past and for the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three Good Things</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. A good nap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. A good bath… A bath where I can fit in the tub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Hearing a baby cry when it’s first born. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 126</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s inspiration was about getting out of my own way. Essentially, I am my biggest obstacle to completing this challenge. Throughout the challenge, my greatest challenges were from within. It wasn’t peer pressure or wanting to fit in; it was my own internal dialogue that alcohol was special and that it wasn’t harmful. Personally, it’s easier to brush people off than it is for me to ignore myself. I really liked how the inspiration also highlighted that I am not all my thoughts. I am not defined by my maladaptive thoughts. I’m defined by the part of me that thinks rationally and challenges those thoughts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 127</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today’s inspiration encouraged me to think about goals that other people have for me as well as financial goals. The irony is that I could care less about both. I believe it would be beneficial to think more about finances. However, outside of becoming less dependent on debt, I’m at a loss. Once I make a financial goal, I usually want more. The returns and process don’t feel as good as other goals. Yes, I’ll have more money, but in the process I’m usually burnt out. My goal could be to live with less, but I don’t have the bandwidth to downsize right now with my family growing. Everyone else’s goals for me are also equally as meh for me. The drive for most of my goals is a personal reason that resonates deeply. Someone else’s desires doesn’t hit the same. I may be avoiding doing the work today, but I really don’t have much interest in those types of goals right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:100px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want more information about the One Year No Beer program.

This is setting you up to be who the narcissist wants you to be .  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">This way when the narcissist comes home at 2 am, or says out all night, he/she will blame it on work, and you will believe this alibi because he/she told you from the get-go that he was committed to working.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">However, what may be really happening is that he could have a side family who needs his attention, or she could have a side man, etc.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">If this is happening to you then you are dating the wrong person.  You don’t want to be with someone who is trying to control you with strategies of implanting seeds into your mind.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">The narcissist is trying to turn you into a puppet who will eventually be doing everything he/she wants because there will be so many seeds planted in your mind that you will soon forget who you really are, and you will be navigating in a mind that was created by the narcissist.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">So, even when you think that you are being a free thinker, you are actually just making choices based upon what the narcissists gave you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">For example, if your mother bought you 50 pairs of jeans, and 50 sweaters, when you create your outfits the style is yours, however, the style is created based upon the fashion that your mom bought you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">If you had the choice of buying your own fashion, would you have created the same outfits? </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">☢️ Is he or she the type to show off?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">☢️ Is he or she always bragging by showing off fancy stuff, showing pictures of cars, expensive vacations, money, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-vivid-purple-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background has-medium-font-size\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:800;\">☢️ Is the relationship moving fast? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">They will shower you with “love”, “affection”, gifts, and attention.  If this is happening in your life, you may  have experienced a manipulation tactic called <em>love bombing</em>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Love bombing is purposely done to make you vulnerable.  Whenever a human being starts catching feeling too quickly, he/she becomes vulnerable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Some people will spend a lot of their time and resources love bombing you until you gain interest and invest in them. Then when you show them that you are “into” them, they start to play the ghosting game.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-vivid-purple-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">☢️ Is he or she smothering you with attention?  </h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Are they always texting, and calling? Does he or she always asking for your location, they want to know where you are all of the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-vivid-purple-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:800;\">☢️ Does he believe that feminine energy means to cook and clean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Abusers will treat their spouse like a maid in the name of male privilege. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Is he asking you to submit to him even though you guys aren’t married?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he/she make fun of you, and constantly judge you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he/she try to humiliate you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Is he/she “friends” with people who are known to be interested in him/her?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Is he passive aggressive and petty?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Is he controlling?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he avoid being blamed for stuff by “playing dumb”?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Are you a vulnerable person?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Are you a an emotional person?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Is he/she making you feel like you are losing your mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he/she freeze you out?  Does he/she use silent treatment to get his/her way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he/she ignore your feelings?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-vivid-purple-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\" style=\"font-size:24px;font-style:normal;font-weight:800;\">☢️ Does he/she isolate you from others?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">If the person you are dating is trying to cause issues between you are your family & friends then you are dealing with an evil person.  It is more than likely that you are dating a narcissist with NPD.  A narcissist with NPD is a control freak.  He/she wants to control you, and he/she does so by attacking your mind.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Your mind is a third of your soul.  Your soul is made up of your mind, will, and emotions. The narcissist with NPD will attack your mind by first destroying the regularity of your emotions. This is why he/she will ignore you, then surprisingly give you a lot of attention, then demean you, etc.  He/she wants you to be on an emotional roller-coaster, but he/she doesn’t want anyone on that entire ride but you and him.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Divide and conquer is a war strategy that has been effectively used for decades.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">When you divide you weaken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">He/she wants you alone so that you don’t get the opinions and perspectives of other people who he/she is not able to manipulate.  He/she wants to separate you from the people who love you, and will protect you from his/her evil doings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">He/she will ONLY want you around his/her people, and his/her friends, because he/she knows how to manipulate them.  Plus, his/her friends and family are similar natured to him/her.  Birds of a feather flock together, remember.  These friends and family of his/her will soon become flying monkeys in your life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">The issue is that, one day this person who you are dating is going to get you into a vulnerable situation.  For many people their vulnerable moment with the narcissist with NPD occurred (1) when she got pregnant, (2) when he moved in with her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Then all of a sudden the mask slipped.  All of a sudden the person you were dating for all of these years shows you a side of them that is so disgusting, that if you saw it before you would have never put yourself in this vulnerable position.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">BUT WAIT …now you are in this vulnerable situation with this narcissist with NPD who is talking to you crazy, and treating you extremely poorly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">When you look around, you may find hat you have ZERO FRIENDS.   This is the plan all along.  This narcissist with NPD was faking all of this time before.  He/she was holding all of the evil inside until you agreed to be in a vulnerable situation with him/her where it would not be easy for you to escape.  Now, it is not just about the ability for you to escape because you are not under physical lock and key.  It is much more complex than that.  The issue is that you have been under psychological warfare this whole time.  Therefore, your cognition skills are not at its’ bet.  If the narcissist with NPD is any good, he has been taking you on that emotional roller coaster since the day you met.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">You  probably have become less creative and stopped having as much passion for your craft like you did before you met the narcissist with NPD.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">You escaping this stronghold will depend on your faith in God and how mentally tough you are.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he/she <a href=\"https://sexybraintv.wordpress.com/2022/03/02/what-is-gaslighting-in-simple-terms-%f0%9f%8d%a6%f0%9f%8d%a8-sexy-brain-tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">gaslight </a>you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he/she guilt-trip you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Is he/she self obsessed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he/she appear to be charming?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he/she always deny blame/never accepts blame?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>☢️ Does he/she avoid deep conversations, and instead keep it casual?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-vivid-purple-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-vivid-purple-background-color has-background is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-vivid-purple-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">☢️ Is the person you are dating asking you heavy questions about the future too soon in the relationship?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background\">3 weeks into the relationship, did he say he wants to marry you and have a family with you?

There have been many cases where girls/guys who were abused are unable to fully see their self worth since their parents and family have been trying to destroy their self esteem from day one out the womb.

Sometimes the balance is in one direction or the other. It is the blessing and the curse of the human condition that we are destined to live by these happenings in our lives and the lives of our loved ones. It is very often that the hard times feel like they go on forever, and the sweetness in life gets diluted by the things that can drive us down. There is no handbook on how we deal with these things, and there is no shortage of explanations, reasoning, and advice on the expectations of how we should deal with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the ongoing events in the world today, which I will leave you to pick from, which has no lack of a historical back catalogue to choose from, and it makes you wonder how anyone at any time ever is in control of how happy they are. Were we ever? I recently watched a documentary about the loss suffered by some families that were heart-breaking in its telling and more so in realising the realities they now live with. Some after a passage of time, and some more immediate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of a series of stories I came across that, in all cases, were human-made situations, with human-made suffering tailored in many instances by human perpetrators. Yet, the level of kindness observed by others when people are struggling or in need is an equally powerful human gesture and an expression that we can be better. This expression of kindness is often translated into action after an unfortunate event, but does it need to be always that way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kindness never seems to translate very well on a global scale, and more often than not, it is an intensely personal thing leveraging our own life experiences to sustain it. These days, people call out others’ “fake” kindnesses. I wonder how kind they are in their lives? I have found that whether it is with my family, my friends or at work when I put kindness at the forefront of my every action, it is then that my space, my world becomes a more positive liveable space to be in. I would go as far as to say that I try to practice kindness, as I do not always succeed. It would be naive to think that everyone being kind would solve every problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Kindness begins with the understanding that we all struggle” Charles Glassman</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I challenge you to take the edge off of someone’s struggle. Bring down a barrier or two and express a part of yourself that may or not be regularly brought to the fore, or maybe it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be courageous. Be kind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please share your views on experiences related to kindness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewpenrose/\">Andrew Penrose</a> for the guest post.

There is never an easy answer for this because in all honesty, there can be many reasons. But first let’s take a look at abuse as a whole. What is abuse really and what behaviors constitute a domestic violence label?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"222\" data-permalink=\"https://itstheteakettle.wordpress.com/2022/05/14/why-they-stay-a-look-at-why-people-dont-leave-domestic-violence/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2-59-53-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://itstheteakettle.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am.png\" data-orig-size=\"1190,1078\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://itstheteakettle.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://itstheteakettle.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am.png?w=1024\" src=\"https://itstheteakettle.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-222\" srcset=\"https://itstheteakettle.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am.png?w=1024 1024w, https://itstheteakettle.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am.png?w=150 150w, https://itstheteakettle.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am.png?w=300 300w, https://itstheteakettle.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am.png?w=768 768w, https://itstheteakettle.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2021-08-16-at-2.59.53-am.png 1190w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To clarify, abuse can happen to anyone, regardless of age, sex, religion, or race. The above wheel refers to “she,” but abuse can happen to men too.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abusers break down your self worth and make you feel like you have no choice but to stay. Not to mention sometimes it’s not safe to leave because the abuser will track down the one being abused and still harm them. Many individuals suffering abuse have come to rely on their abuser for a multitude of reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Finances. Often times, abusers refuse to let their target work because that gives their target a sense of autonomy and independence. Ways an abuser may stop their target from working is by verbal and mental use and even showing up at their target’s job to threaten or take them home.</li><li>Cutting off family and friends or even creating lies about their target to cause family to stop speaking to the target</li><li>Home, vehicle, etc in both names and abuser refuses to give up their part in these things so that the target could be independent. </li><li>Children. Abusers use the children as a way to manipulate their target by threatening to take them away or finding ways to make it so the target can’t provide for the children independently. </li><li>Safety. There have been many statistics of abuse victims leaving their abusers and they wind up being severely punished or even killed for leaving.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The other factors on <em>why</em> people stay in abusive situations are many. It could be the targeted individual is a child and their authority figure or primary caregiver is abusive. It could also be the targeted individual has found a romantic partner who’s abusive <em>because</em> their parent or family member was. In a sense, this abuse has been made normal to them and they need support to recognize they are being mistreated. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Survivors of Abuse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though I won’t go into details about my own abuse, I will say that most people need help to get out of an abusive situation. There are many organizations geared towards helping people who are abused get to safety. In my case I was able to work with a center for domestic violence who helped me find my own place to live and worked with me to get me back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of those who have endured abuse are shamed and ridiculed for staying. From my personal experience, depending on the circumstances, the first step in leaving the abuse is to recognize it’s abuse and that the one dishing it out can’t be changed by anyone other than themselves. Abuse is about power and control. It’s a choice someone makes. Sometimes people feel sorry for the abuser, saying that they were drunk or it was an accident. Remember that abuse is a choice that someone has made. They are choosing to mistreat someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, female abusers are just as common as male abusers, but less is reported by men. Some men feel it lessens their character or its a sign of weakness. But if more people came forward with abuse, organizations would be more readily available to them. Security is always of utmost importance when it comes to seeking help from abuse. There are numerous resources available.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Shame Behind Abuse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With surviving abuse comes a high price to pay, with society feeding us shame from very young ages. The most important things to remember:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Nothing you did or didn’t do caused your abuse. Again, abuse is a choice for people with power to control others.</li><li>There’s nothing wrong with you. Even if you were abused, there’s nothing about your character or personality that makes it the reason behind your abuse.</li><li>No matter what others say, they weren’t there in your situation so they don’t know what they would have done if they had been.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Shame from abuse in my opinion stems from low self-esteem and low self-image. This isn’t anyone’s fault as this is driven into us from childhood. The great thing is that self-esteem can be built up with skills that anyone can learn on their own or with a therapist. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To sum it all up, abuse is systematic and the long term affects can very well keep someone from leaving an abusive relationship. Remember you don’t know the person or what they have gone through.</p>\n",

And you’re worried about the color of a door…on someone else’s house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later I spoke with my husband because I know it bothers him when I break down in social situations and it is something I’m working on.  I apologized for the manner how it happened, but I would/will not apologize for what I said.  I told him I don’t understand how people can think that way.  Even as selfish as we are, we constantly insert ourselves in things that have nothing to do with us.  If you want to look at things that truly impact other people, pick one of the topics I mentioned above.  We are connected on so many levels, but not by the color of a damn door.  My husband looked at me and said in equal frustration, “People don’t think like that.”  To which I replied, “That is the damn problem.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While my husband was trying to make the point he understood how people function, I was trying to make the point that this is the type of thing that leads to our destruction.  Inserting ourselves in things that are none of our business and have no impact on us personally removes us from the big picture. We just want to voice an opinion to feel like we matter and we want people to change their behavior at our demand so we feel powerful.  While this may be the common behavior, it is not working.  This is what has led us to this point right now: women fighting for reproductive rights, insane gas prices, people working horrible jobs to barely survive, corrupt politicians, and the myriad of other global issues like global warming, a little pandemic, and a looming war to name a few.  See, when we micromanage the daily lives of others, we lose sight of the big picture and how we are REALLY connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After my tirade, my husband said the words I hate the most, “There’s nothing we can do about it.” And he is right only to a degree.  I can’t make people see what I do.  I can’t make people care about these things like I do but I can certainly continue to voice this.  The truth is, in his statement he opened up what I feel is the greatest issue in the world: we’ve all been deceived to think we can’t do anything about it, that we are locked into this way of life.  He’s repeating what he was taught.  The reality of that is he never even got the things he was promised for following this path—neither of us has.  We’ve spent our 21 years together finding who we are and eventually “doing as we were told” in order to achieve what we thought was the dream…for far more effort than we knew.  Granted, I do not regret where we are and I believe it all happens for a reason, but I know if we had taken the time to figure out what WE wanted prior to diving in, we may have made some different decisions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my friends, the point is that we are connected, absolutely and completely.  We just aren’t connected by the color of our neighbor’s door.  If you want to fight, fight for something that matters.  And if you don’t know what that is, find something that matters to you.  Expand your circle and your perception and find a way to put yourself in something bigger.  Work to redefine how you perceive the world and where you can have an impact.  Glennon Doyle shared her daughter’s polar bear story in <em>Untamed.</em> The gist of this story is her daughter obsessed over saving the polar bears and it drove Glennon crazy until one night her daughter said, “It’s just that now it’s the polar bears, and one day it will be us.”  And THAT is the truth.  If we don’t care about what matters now, it will be our undoing.  Let’s fix what we can on a bigger scale rather than worry about someone’s color choice. Watch how that turns things around.</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all been guilty.  You may have seen someone in a store & made assumptions about them because they look unkept.  You may have walked in on a situation you’re not fully informed on and make instant judgements.  There may be age groups you avoid because they are considered “annoying know it alls” (you know what generation and I don’t even need to type it!).  You might have heard a coworker talking about their spouse and instantly get caught up in their emotions that are only half the story.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if that person at the store is sick, stayed home from their corporate job that makes more money than you, and does volunteer work at a local shelter.  They live alone so they had to buy their own cold meds…Your perception was WRONG.  What if the situation you walked in on was nothing but because you had no information, you made snap judgements which turned it into something…You meddled and created drama.  What if you refuse to have a conversation with a 23 yr old because the stigma of his generation.  He was excited to explain the crypto currency market to you but didn’t get the chance…You just missed his intelligence and possibly money made.  What if you call the authorities on your coworkers husband just to learn later that she in fact was the abuser. The tears you witnessed are because he told her it was over…You’ve now put an innocent person under investigation.   See how perceptions are literally the worst way to make judgements?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Definition of Perception- To become aware of (something) by the use of one of the senses, especially that of sight.</strong> </em>                                                                                                                                                                          In my experience this can be very tricky and not very accurate.  We view others through the lenses of our own experiences.  What is unacceptable for one person is totally acceptable for another.  What is dangerous for one may be adventure for another.  Then you must take into account upbringing, age, societal conditioning, culture, economic class, and individual trauma reactions or symptoms.  These ALL play a role in how somebody goes about their human experience.  We have no way of knowing any of those things as an outsider looking in.  At the same time, our perceptions are skewed by the very things I listed above also.  We look at others circumstances through a filter of our own experiences.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, I was in a trauma based marriage for at least 3/4 of the relationship.  Yelling triggers me and I will either cower down (Freeze), raise my voice higher than others (Fight), or leave the area (Flight).  I never know what reaction will happen but I am not just chill and relaxed, no matter the circumstances.  My current husband came from a loud family.  Voices were frequently raised, not out of anger, but out of habit due to the amount of people in the home he grew up with and the voice level he was raised with.  When we got into our first argument he raised his voice ever so slightly, and I bolted!  Thank goodness he was very aware of my past and immediately changed his voice level to talk me back so we could fix the issue.  If he knew nothing about my past and he knew nothing about my trauma he would PERCEIVE my walking away as an unwillingness to come to a solution.  He may have followed me with the same voice level causing me more trauma.  It could have turned into something when it was really nothing.  Just a disagreement over something little that needed a resolution could have escalated into me thinking he was just like my ex. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p>Perceptions ARE judgements wrapped in a sweet new word to make it sound less shitty.  (Actually, a synonym for “perceive” is “judge”) But perceptions are in fact one sided and often inaccurate.  A child’s perception is going to be pretty far off base because they don’t have nor do they need ALL the informations that causes their teacher to make certain rules or expectations for their classroom.  Same goes for their parents at home.  A coworkers perceptions of a boss piling work onto them usually doesn’t even drift into what their boss’s higher ups may be telling them to do as far as the employees work load.  A neighbor’s perceptions about an unkept yard may not stretch to a Drs diagnosis of their neighbor with a chronic disease.  They may be viewed as lazy with no consideration of the human life that certain neighbor is currently navigating.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p>There are many roles in society that use perception in determining if actions are needed or if further steps should be taken. This can be extremely handy in situations where time is valuable or a long drawn out process isn’t the best practice.  For instance, a security guard or employee of a store may use their perception of your behavior or movements to determine if you are possibly shoplifting.  When pulled over for a traffic infraction, a police officer will use their perception of your mannerisms to determine if you are a threat or if you are impaired.  A teacher may watch children come in from recess and use their perception to pick up on any issues that happened on the playground with kids that may follow them into the classroom.  A future employer will use perception when looking over a resume and conducting an interview to see if you are a good fit for their company.  ALL these roles and many more determine their plan of action based on how they perceive things to be.  These perceptions are valuable in most cases and greatly needed in order to keep others safe if circumstances warrant.  The problem is, HUMANS are making these judgements through their personal lenses of experience.  Even when in a job title that requires being completely impartial, you can’t just remove those lenses.  It is part of their human makeup.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As a person who brushes off judgements, because simple psychology tells us they really have nothing to do with you, I struggle with this classy “perception” word.  Too often it seems those with power are making judgements that are inaccurate, based on an outside view of a person or situation.  This is ok as long as you follow what is perceived with inquiries to learn the full picture.  That is where I feel many in powerful positions are slacking.  Fast judgment calls made under stressful circumstances are leading to loss of life, loss of freedoms, false accusations, unjust detainments and the list goes on.  A persons entire life can be altered by one person in a powerful position perceiving them as one thing, when in fact they are the complete opposite. Depending on a person of powers mental health and past life events, ANY situation can constitute an “emergency”. Rash decisions are made every min by people who are not in the right mindset, are not properly trained, and are not getting support from their leaders.  I in no way blame those people.  They are doing what they can in order keep their jobs, help others as much as possible, and pray their choices are the right ones.  They are not broken, the systems that employ them are.  The very systems they work for should be ensuring their workers are mentally and emotionally able to make reliable and accurate decisions and not triggered by an event they are in charge of handling.  This is not being done.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 began a big shift in the human experience.  For years some of us had been talking about the incoming shift, although I know I personally never expected the degree of how fast our existence would change.  The virus we have all been avoiding is just a small part of the shift and not even the main focus of the changes to come.  The systems that have managed and ruled us that were put in place forever ago, no longer work.  Big government, legal systems, law enforcement, and many others are under attack because people are waking up, seeing the cracks, and unwilling to just do what they are told to do when it doesn’t resonate with them.  When laws we are told to follow go against a personal moral or value we hold dear, we are speaking up.  It is happening globally and although it can be scary at times now, I feel this is the beginning of the complete breakdown of those broken systems.  Whats going to take their place?  I have no clue to be honest but astrologically speaking, we are in for many more big changes and shake ups.  It has begun in law enforcement, continues into the courts system, and many falsehoods are being revealed in government entities.  All systems where perceptions made by humans with trauma, are in charge of judging the general public, are no longer being tolerated by those who are AWAKE.  (Not “woke” and don’t get me started on how annoying that word is to me)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<hr class=\"wp-block-coblocks-dynamic-separator\" style=\"height:50px;\" />\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I have had three huge  “Awakenings” as they are called.  Most people who aim to help others have.  They will also tell you, it’s not a wonderful time.  Real talk, they kinda suck in the moment.  Awakenings are meant to shake you to the core.  They are huge revelations you have about yourself, your existence, and your beliefs.  They make you question your logical thinking up to that point and investigate the Shadow Side of your being.  We all have the opportunities for these awakenings, but most see the huge problem at hand and only work to solve that.  They don’t do the hard, tearing yourself open to investigate work that causes actual change within ourselves.  Hence, they miss the chance to evolve through it, and a different form of that initial problem will surface again in the future.  Awakenings are hard AF & if your told they are anything but, you’re being lied to!</p>\n\n\n\n<p> A common theme I have noticed personally each time is JUDGEMENT.  My 1st huge awakening brought forward the judgement I had felt from my ex in our 20 year marriage.  My words, actions, and entire being had to be a certain way.  I then became very judgmental of others who didn’t fit into that mold and discovered my jealousy for those who were allowed to be authentic.  This was no longer acceptable to me and I left to live my most authentic existence for the 1st time in my adult life.  My 2nd awakening came when I decided to leave a partnership with a person who had supported me through the separation from my 20 yr marriage.  I struggled leaving a friendship that had been helpful and I felt obligated to.  The decision to walk away came after I heard words of encouragement towards clients, to be followed with harsh judgements behind closed doors to others.  Her words were judgements with no compassion and it didn’t match what was being “preached”.  I had no choice but to leave what did not align with my morals.  I could no longer be part of something that felt more hurtful than helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The awakening I am currently navigating is the hardest and biggest yet in the lesson of judgement.  It solidifies how we should NEVER judge a person by perceptions, others peoples words or accounts, or go by anything that doesn’t involve getting full and complete sides of all involved.  It has increased my distaste of judgmental thinking patterns and makes me look forward to a new and better way of navigating this human experience.  I have looked at myself and how I had continued to judge others under the guise of being helpful.  It has opened my eyes to a whole new different type of judgment, that is hidden behind fancy words, that are made to hide that you are in fact being looked at through a human lens of another’s experiences.  I am being shown ways that I too have perceived things with others through the lens of my own past trauma.  I am being forced to see ugliness in areas where I had been wearing rose colored glasses.  I am being shaken to awaken once more and know that so many miracles await on the other side of it because thats the gift of awakenings.  My empathy towards others has grown as I experience the lack of empathy from those who are not awake.  I am choosing to grow in ways that are so damn uncomfortable, but necessary to move forward and thrive on the other side of this shift in human consciousness.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will get into the details of this final lesson in future blogs as I have not learned all I am suppose to yet and am still in the trenches of the muddiness.  It has been in this navigation that the theme of judgement & perceptions revealed itself in my awakenings.  (Control is ALWAYS a part also but I have blogged on that subject).  Not having a traditional job during this time of shadow work and breaking open has given me the chance to dive into every nook and cranny, which is why I HAD to write and share my revelations. I have made many observations, taken hard looks at society and myself, explored astrology, reviewed past awakenings, spoke at length with close friends, and drew off of others experiences to come to the conclusions I have outlined here. I have been questioned and second guessed by others in this personal shift I am in, which are also different ways used to judge others in a pretty package.  It doesn’t feel good, it has changed my perspective on who truly supports me, and has opened my eyes to a multitude of “common practices” many use that are just downright shitty! Whether your in an official capacity or your a common citizen, if you think you have the right to question someone who is living differently than you or is making choices that you wouldn’t make, you better have lived their exact experience or frankly…Sit down. Your judgmental opinion means nothing and you’re wasting your energy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To recap, the world has been going through a bunch of big changes.  Many are seeing that the people we have let rule our lives are simple humans like us who may be broken themselves.  Their traumas, if not healed and constantly worked on, can cloud their perception and cause additional trauma to those they are making decisions about.  The systems that rule us are no longer working due to the lack of empathy and clear thinking needed to make accurate perceptions of others.  There will continue to be breakdowns from the top of countries all the way down to our personal selves until we have shed all the practices that have no room in the new world that is trying to emerge.  The struggles we are coming up against now are opportunities for awakenings into a higher consciousness if we allow them to be. When we do the shadow work on ourselves to see how we have contributed to the old systems, we heal the collective one revelation at a time.  Be open and accepting of the lessons, knowing that the heartache they may be causing in this moment is equal to the miracles that wait for you in the future.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong><em>Please subscribe for instant notifications</em></strong> <strong><em>sent directly to your inbox!

But with 25 coming up in less than two months I’m in the middle of what Taylor Tomlinson would call a “quarter life crisis.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s scary being almost a quarter into your full life and still questioning who you are, where you want to be in life and what are you going to do to get there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have almost 0 answers to all of those questions. I do not know what I want in life. I do not know who I am anymore, all I know is the road I am currently on is not the one I want to be on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Do I like my current boyfriend and plan to marry him one day? </em>Absolutely. But everything else is honestly a complete blur at the moment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Where do I want to live?</em> Not my current province is a guarantee but with the Covid issue never seeming to fuck off, I haven’t been anywhere to find my place where I can call <em>home</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Who do I want to be?</em> Who the fuck knows. How does someone answer that question when they’ve grown up in oppression so they were never allowed and shamed when exploration should have been encouraged. I like funky hair and tattoos and piercings but that doesn’t define me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am an artist, a web developer and a plant and animal mom but that also does not define of who Wren is so honestly how do you answer the question of who you <em>want </em>to be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have adhd, I am not adhd. I love re-branding (<em>hence the new pretty blog updates</em>) but that’s not who I am either. How do you find you? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought I knew who I was. I am <strong>Wren</strong>. But as much as a legal name change makes me start to feel whole, that’s not the extent of who I am and who I want to be. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots\" />\n\n\n\n<p>See the issue here? Definitely a crisis. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re twenties are supposed to be all about finding who you are and my twenties have been removing all the oppression and twirling in circles. I am tired of twirling in circles. I am tired of not knowing what I want to do with my life and just trying to guess what would make my life feel <em>good</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is too short to do everything and I am learning that the hard way. I can’t do everything and it makes me depressed because I want to try and go and do everything there is to be human. Being human comes with too many freakin choices and how are you just supposed to pick just one and go with it? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do not know. But I am tired of picking up five hundred thousand marbles and expecting them all to turn out how I hoped instead of perusing one with everything that I have in me to make it good. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So what do I do with 101 different hobbies and not one that I think I could do over the others? </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life sucks that way. If you do not pick what you want to do, you never get to pick. And if you pick one and then hop to another, you regret your choice five years in. I can’t win. But I also can’t live my life pretending this heavy adhd mindset is getting me anywhere. I have to pick and I have to suffer for my choice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too many choices and not enough answers. Fuck you Covid for making this more hard. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Wren ❤</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Confessions of a Serial Interviewer by Steven Ra Ga</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the time I was 18yrs of age to 24 I held various jobs that involved working in a warehouse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had flunked out of College on the account of drinking too much and not knowing where I wanted to go with a career. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result I needed a job and with a high school education all I could qualify for was Warehouse jobs unless I wanted to work on the Rigs, but I avoided that like COVID. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friends at the time would tell me stories from up north. How the big the bugs were, the violence, the pay, loosing fingers. They basically made it seem like a nightmare working environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So warehouse it was. One of my 1st jobs in a warehouse was Future Shop the brother of Best Buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Future Shop was a weird place, the job was like typical duties, stocking shelves and unloading trucks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s actually where I met my best friend Larry, he and I would have many, many drunken adventures and fishing trips over the years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While working Larry and I bonded over who could injure the other more,  not on purpose, but we always seemed to accidentally hurt one another. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weather it be an elbow to the face, getting smacked with a large speaker while turning or running into someone with a skid loader. Someone always got hurt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one time though neither of us got hurt but our coworkers did. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one day a guy (Jon) who was little about 5’4” and maybe 90lbs worked in the warehouse, that day they were unloading the truck taking skids off with a pallet jacket. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is normal but the gate (ramp) always had a bump in it, so you had to slow down on your approach otherwise the skid would tip and you would spend hours picking broken items. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon was at the base of the dock, counting inventory while Larry was inside the truck. Larry started to move a skid off the truck but was coming to fast, the skid hit the bump and went up and over it sped down the ramp and crushed poor Jon between to skids as he leaped up to get out of the way. Jon wasn’t too badly hurt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another time our manage Kevin was unloading a tall large skid and something similar happened. The skid hit the bump and rocketed off the pallet smashing Kevin in the shoulder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That place was crazy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another time there was a garbage strike and cardboard started piling up in the warehouse it got so problematic that it was like a giant wall of cardboard. We had to use shrink wrap to hold it up. Until the management finally told use to get it out of the shop. We filled up the bay outside with it enough that we started taking turns doing flips on to it like it was a ball pit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is when I found a box filled with cameras and cell phones. I recall taking the box to our manager and asking if we are suppose to throw away new tech, this is when management caught on their was a thief among us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually Jon was caught stealing. He apparently had been stealing items for a very long time and hiding them all over the shop. The camera security was so bad you would have show the item you are stealing just to get caught. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another time the store owner sat on this empty box and fell inside, hilarious. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Future Shop was like any department store it had a collective of lost souls looking for a place to calm home. After quitting I eventually came back for two other seasons. My final season I had enough, I got paid $8.50 an hour but when they hired new staff they would pay them $10 per hour, I tried to get a raise but that wasn’t in my cards so I office spaced the fuck out, I stopped showing up on time and generally stopped carrying. There was this other guy who worked at the warehouse he was older than me and South Korean, his English was okay, his story was he had moved to Calgary for love and the daughter he wanted to marry, her father didn’t like Bob so he sent the girls Uncle to our city to get a job in the same facility to keep and eye on him, or so that was the story, he could have been North Korean for all I know. I bring him up because one Monday it was inventory day, you come in at 5am and count every time in the store, it goes by kinda fast if you have a few guys. Bob and I were scheduled to come in, and I didn’t care and more, so I showed up at 9am when I got there Bob looked at me from the rafters and in his broken English he yells Fuck You Steven, I couldn’t help myself but burst into laughter. Hahaha Bob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another time there was a guy named Nick who was from China, we loved talking with Nick he would reach us mandarin and we would teach him English. Nick and Bob used to fight, they would tell another to fuck off in their broken English it was too funny to witness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larry was always good a hiding. He would arrange TVs in the back on the shelves to sleep on during his shifts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years later I work for Larry at his current job, we do carpentry work here and there to help him take his mind off his bizarre marriage, without airing too much dirty laundry, he found his wife has been having infidelity and has also come out as non binary… life is a social construct… poor Larry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My life though has been an adventure one interview and job after another… I should have been an actor they lead similar lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a spell I worked at a well known brand name water supplier in there warehouse. They only hired me but they should have hire 2-3 people as the job had a lot of responsibilities. At the time I had just flunked out of college and needed something. This position seemed fitting. It was a company that supplied those 50lbs water jugs mostly to office water coolers, they also do water tanks and later coffee, also this weird acid solution for septic tanks. The interview was weird my managers name was Bob, when he introduced me to the sales team and other management team, he would say “so this guy is Bob, and that guy is Bob and this other guy is Bob.” I thought he was taking a piss, having a laugh or pulling my leg (prank or joke) on me, but no he was serious. He managed to hire other people who had the name Bob… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My role was simple, operate the forklift, unload trucks that had new water, load trucks that had no water or used. Unload trucks that had new equipment for the sale team, clean the the water heater tanks, help customers who came to the mobile window to pick up, water and salt for water softener tanks, keep the warehouse clean, rotate the salt pallets – and mix chemicals for the septic tanks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first it wasn’t all the bad, I worked hard in the summer, in the winter things got tough. I needed a car to get to work but I couldn’t afford one so I would take the bus and train and walk, often I would be so cold I would have unthaw my legs 20mins before a shift started. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the job dragged on, I had numerous encounters with older men who were hardens by their life choices who told me I should go to art school (kinda like that Ben afflict scene in good will hunting where he tells Matt Damond to just fuck off and leave town, because he is too smart to break bricks for a living) anyway I ultimately did listen, but now I am back where I started (another story for another time).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While at the water company I recall many a day when I would be set to move a stack of salt that weighed over 2,000lbs with the forklift and as I went to raise it off the stack, the pallet would bust in half and the salt bags would poor out all over the place. I would then spend an hour lifting each 50lbs bag and put it back on to a new pallet. It sucked when that would happen and then a customer would come to the window for their order or a truck would come at the same time. I was always scrambling around the warehouse trying to do everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t recall how long I stayed at that job but I quit after they started adding too many responsibilities and not enough extra pay. This was back when minimum wage was $7 per hour so maybe I was making $9 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company decided they wanted to take on coffee for companies so I used to have to add coffee inventory to my already packed list of duties. There would be like 30 coffee pots that had to be sanitized and washed before they could be sent out. And since the company was cheap, I would have to line them up on the ground in rows, fill each individually with water and solution, run off and fulfill all my duties, run back to cleans and dry theme so they were ready for the next go. When I asked for more staff or help I got rejected…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon after I stopped carrying, I would rip donuts in the parking lot with the forklift, stomp, jump and run all over the salt towers, purposely damage water jugs because it was fun to watch them explode because I wanted to get fired. They never did fire me, it was like a scene from the movie office space. So eventually I just left…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t seem to recall other warehouse positions that were strictly that. I do however have had positions that included some warehouse duties…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will do those in another post. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Can you get rid of guilt of killing for honour? … this novel raises so many questions from a variety of perspectives. What is “honour” to a sister, a daughter, a loving son, an unforgiving son, a wife, a community of the same faith, a society of many faiths… I loved the story line, and the dual timelines, and every single character. Shafak is a unique writer to me, as she breaths the life into her characters as if she lived each of their stories separately and then jointly. And she does so with grace and humility. </p>\n",

This level of insight is not just profound, it is necessary and comes to us with ease. It will help us to sort out what is true and what is false, even if that means breaking away from the heard or other people’s expectations of how we should behave. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having two Sage cards beside one another can show how the suits of Wands and Cups work together. When we become attuned to our higher selves (Wands), our purpose is much more accessible. This level of connection is derived from our dedication to our path and what holds up to a strength of validity that only we have quantified. An understanding on this level provides us with the ability to stay above certain emotional currents that tend to pull us either down or away from our centre by clouding the landscape with debris that we could otherwise react to or get lost in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “Seer” card tells us that we are very aware of the undercurrents and vibrational qualities in our environment. Further, our awareness informs us of what is wholesome, productive, and vibrant because we are participating with this information on a higher level or from a higher perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as the air is cleaner in the mountains, so too is our mind when it is elevated from the mundane crisscrossing confusion that influences our focus. The Sage of Wands represents the ability to know how this energy works and to apply a natural response that is refined, clean, untarnished, aligned, and attuned to the universe and to ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we have this ability to see into things, we also get to apply our emotional wisdom so that our lives are filled with joy and exuberance. Rising above entanglements and bathing in the clean refreshing waters of those mountain streams not only cleanses our mindstream but also allows us to provide this environment for others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sages are examples. They are those wise teachers and elders. They are our wisest aspect of our psyche. They show us how to rise above the confusion and mess of a cluttered world and to operate in clarity. What we seem to be applying this to is the need to stand on our own and not be surprised if being at the top feels a bit lonely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people find it hard to step away from groups because of the inherent inclusion and need for validation that groups provide. If we can’t step away because of a fear of being on our own, then we will generally choose groups that could contribute to an imbalanced need for approval that might undermine our true path and purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standing alone is the dedication we feel to what is right for ourselves. The Sages are informing us of that clarity and they are helping us to tune into that information. The 9 of Wands says, hold onto that clarity because it is the most authentic path to our future. Have the courage to go it alone and walk away from people, environments or mindsets that don’t serve you anymore. This is an initiation into a higher level of understanding and of operating in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><strong>Affirmation:</strong> I value the insights I gain right now.

In this movie she goes around living her life in search of something, in her case romantic love, and doesn’t realize that the whole time she’s been holding her breath. She finds this thing that she’s been looking for and she feels like she can just exhale and breathe and relax. She found her peace. It was what she needed.  That is what I think about when I read that meme. That almost indescribable feeling that infuses you when you realize that you no longer need validation. When your true self comes front and center and you no longer operate by the status quo. The intense peace that brings is so beautiful and sacred. In my case, I was holding my breath too, but it wasn’t romantic love I was looking for, it was self-love. Part of figuring out how to love myself meant figuring out what I believed was true for myself. Not what I have been told. Not what other people told me was true. Not what other people believed. What I believed. What resonated with my soul. I realized that I no longer had a driving desire to explain myself to everybody I met. I no longer felt defensive about my beliefs. I went from feeling like I lived my entire life outside of my body, always at the command of everyone else, to knowing I reside within myself.  I reside within myself! How freeing!!! I’m still very willing to have conversations with people about what I know(and don’t know) for myself, but I lost all inclinations to hunt people down and explain myself at all costs. No arguments, no defensiveness,  what’s for me is mine and doesn’t require external approval.  A few years ago I would have believed it when people told me that was a selfish way to live. Now I know that it is exactly the opposite. That really being true to myself and who I am and what I need, enables me to have such a great amount of peace that I feel that I can show up for other people in the way that they need me to show up for them without compromising who I am. It also means that I have less problems eliminating things from my life that are draining, unhealthy, and toxic. I no longer want to defend myself. Now I want to celebrate myself. It also makes me want to celebrate others who’ve been able to find that deep peace within themselves, for themselves. It’s kind of addicting actually. It’s not always the easiest road, but I believe the world would be a better place if more people took that less traveled path. The profound peace you get as a reward is absolutely worth it.</p>\n",

And if I’m not mistaken the last blog was even about highs and lows. But it seems like that is just the norm here lately. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My poor daughter lost her pup of 15 years. Like over half her life that dog has been by her side. And it was a tragic ending. One that I was not there for. Talk about a heart break x 2. Luckily we have a kick as neighbor who stepped up and was Mama a day. So much gratitude. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the very next week, our Storm girl decided to put a hole in her neck. Thanks chick. Another vet bill. 😥. Luckily it was an easy fix and she healed like a champ, barley a scar. Thanks Jay and Odell, y’all rock. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the very next week. My poor BFF and the other part of this B4A team, lost her heart horse. Meg being the rock she is went to help her while yet again, I could not be there. Got her foot stomped on and had to be the rock. Poor Melissa. Oh how she is going to miss Her Daisy May. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then maybe 2 months later, our Poncho dog gets sick out of nowhere. Vet visit it was. Within 2 weeks, my poor poor sweet girl had to say goodbye yet again. Thank you Mark for being there. I could have been, but she said no. She is so strong. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been a whirl wind of junk. My heart breaks because over the losses. My it is happy that I have raised such a strong solid woman. I have my moments of weakness. More often than not, so I can’t take all the credit. But I will take most of it. 🤫</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you all deal with so many heartbreaks all at once? How do you keep moving forward when it seems like you are falling apart? Some days I just wanted to crawl in a hole and not come out. Other days I wanted to move til I couldn’t no more. The more I could move, the slower my mind got. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not easy being a Mom, wife, best friend, animal lover. It’s not easy being tender hearted. (I only look like I’m not to hide that I actually am) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately life is still moving forward. So we have to learn to move with it. Just do t move so fast that you forget to grieve. Take the moment to feel the lows and then you will eventually learn how to feel the highs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-4 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":188453642,\"permalink\":\"https:\\/\\/b4apodcast.wordpress.com\\/2022\\/05\\/14\\/highs-n-lows\\/\"}' class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img data-attachment-id=\"355\" data-permalink=\"https://b4apodcast.wordpress.com/2022/05/14/highs-n-lows/01a5163d-c78b-49bb-b00f-eda008599405/\" data-orig-file=\"https://b4apodcast.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/01a5163d-c78b-49bb-b00f-eda008599405.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1440,1440\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"01a5163d-c78b-49bb-b00f-eda008599405\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://b4apodcast.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/01a5163d-c78b-49bb-b00f-eda008599405.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://b4apodcast.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/01a5163d-c78b-49bb-b00f-eda008599405.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://b4apodcast.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/01a5163d-c78b-49bb-b00f-eda008599405.jpg\" data-id=\"355\" class=\"wp-image-355\" /></figure></li></ul></figure>\n",

An intricate belief, like the sturdy roots of an old tree, is embedded inside me that even from non-complex and monotonous things in life, we can learn and cultivate something entirely good, something that can help us live a considerably better life. How astonishing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this strong belief has led me today to discover a thing quite astounding and truly extraordinary confiding within a much simpler outer shell in disguise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiding beneath the seeming <em>tip</em> that is WORDLE, lies a mountain of possibly life-altering philosophy, which when mimicked correctly in our own lives, can truly help us achieve our goals and dreams: The <strong>WORDLE</strong> Philosophy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before I begin relaying all the papers on this philosophy, we first need to know <em>what </em>it is the philosophy of. It is time to ask:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is WORDLE? </strong><strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Those familiar with the game of WORDLE, feel free to skip this part and head to the next section</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WORDLE is a daily word puzzle game that one can play simply in a web browser (no additional apps required). The game itself is a breeze to get hang of, a big reason why it is particularly trending around the world. The simplest rule of playing states; we have to guess the word of the day in no more than six attempts. It will always be a random five-letter word. Hence, the attempt-grid will invariably consist of a <strong>5×6 matrix</strong> of squares, and would look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1771\" data-permalink=\"http://thoughtsofahuman.home.blog/2022/05/14/the-wordle-philosophy/img_20220404_114901__01-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220404_114901__01-01.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"3764,2117\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.7","credit":"","camera":"ONEPLUS A6010","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1649072942","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.25","iso":"800","shutter_speed":"0.04","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"img_20220404_114901__01-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220404_114901__01-01.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220404_114901__01-01.jpeg?w=1024\" src=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220404_114901__01-01.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1771\" srcset=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220404_114901__01-01.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220404_114901__01-01.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220404_114901__01-01.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220404_114901__01-01.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220404_114901__01-01.jpeg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, when we enter the initial attempt; our first word upon this grid, there are three things that one can find in return indicated by the color change of the letters.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Grey/Black </strong>– These signify the letters which are not present in the final word.</li><li><strong>Yellow – </strong>These hint at the letters which are existing in the answer, but not in the current position that we have entered them.</li><li><strong>Mighty Green! – </strong>As the nature of this color suggests, these letters indicate being at the right spot and are obviously present in the final word to find.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As there are only six attempts that one can make, the ultimate goal of this game is for us to try different calculated words based upon the intricate feedback provided (green, yellow, or black) and find the eventual answer within the given 5×6 grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a <strong>daily </strong>word game, it resets and changes its answer every 24 hours.

I forgot!” I replied to my good friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Today’s word is very tricky! Took me all of my six tries.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Oh,” my eyes widened in response. “Let me try it as well,” and within a flash, I was found staring blankly at the familiar empty square grid of 5×6.<br><em>Today’s word is very tricky.<br></em>My mind remembered, contemplating deeply on what the first try should be. Although I had several common words ready to barge, the term <em>tricky </em>was beginning to mess with my head. Many minutes dared to pass in such manner, and I was still fixated upon the empty and uniformly colored squares in front.<br><em>Try something at least!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incidentally, I went ahead with the word “TRACE”, my strategy being to get the most commonly used letters for a hint at first. I tapped <em>enter </em>and watched in some <strong>horror</strong> as every letter flipped into utter black of its type. Not even a single alphabet was correct! And my heart skipped a beat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sure was stunned, but only for a second or two because I realized that even if the try wasn’t <em>perfect, </em>it seemed necessary to provide me with incredible hints moving forward. As a result, I decided upon using the next word as “WOODS” which contained none of the previously tried letters, yet it should give me some leeway over the final answer. Again the individual letters flipped one by one, revealing “WO” and “D” as still wretched <strong>black</strong>, while the remaining “O” stood green followed by “S” turning yellow towards the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now we are talking!</em><em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considerable levels of encouragement surged within as I began searching the towers of my memory through every five-letter word satisfying the given condition. I ultimately landed on “FROST”, it seemed like a pretty good and calculated guess. But if there is one thing consistent in WORDLE, is that it’s never what it <em>seems </em>like!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While “FR” and “T” still remained utter <strong>black</strong>, I got “OS” both in green this time.<br><em>Man, this is hard!<br></em>I gravely realized, trying to think of a new word that could help me inch closer to the ultimate answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>What else contains “OS” in the middle?<br></em>I tried “GLOSS” next and it managed to give me the whole “LOS” in green. Surprisingly, the last “S” appeared in yellow.<br><em>There are two S’!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new revelation rejuvenated life within me, but the fact that I was already above four tries in total induced severer nervousness. By the process of fairly simple elimination, the new-found “S” could only be correct at the first position. But I had yet to figure out the last letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“SLOS_” I mouthed.<br><em>What could come after S?</em><em><br></em>In an effort of classic brute force, I grew to put each of the un-blackened letters in the last position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SLOSB</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SLOSI</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SLOSH</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Wait…<br>Could it be SLOSH?<br></em>I pondered heavily.<br><em>Is that even a word?<br></em>I weighed in my all options, knowing that this being my fifth attempt, I might as well try it! Evidently, I entered “SLOSH” and watched impatiently as each and every letter slowly turned mighty green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yes!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the above scenario seems like a typical experience of any WORDLE player on the surface, it may surprise you to know that it’s hiding an extremely powerful and possibly <strong>life-altering </strong>philosophy underneath!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our lives, ever-so changing, turbulent, eventful, and vivid, are all held sanely together only by our common aim to reach our self-defined goals. These goals or aspirations typically do not lie in the realm of ease, it is the reason why we so want and are particularly determined to reach them. But what seems even more difficult is the infinite <strong>dilemma </strong>of taking the very first step towards achieving our aim. We often become far too entangled within the web of making an absolute right or “perfect” first step. (I too,  am also guilty of this fact) And just like we tend to dwell upon our first try in WORDLE, we mirror that in life accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let me break an interesting yet crucial fact to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after hundreds of researched articles on it, there is no “correct” first-try word existing for WORDLE, and correspondingly, there is no such absolute “right” step to take when we are taking our all-important initial step towards our main goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the first step is daunting, truly pivotal and it gravely matters in the long run, but not because we take the “perfect” one, but rather because we have the will to take it <strong>no matter what</strong>. And the beauty of WORDLE, which heavily mimics itself in life as well, is that even if you get all the black letters, you are always one step closer to the final goal, always learning crucial information along the way which will lead you to make the next best-try possible. Maybe you get a few yellow, or even green after it. You will learn something again from the experience and the next best-informed decision will be the result of it, all towards reaching your ultimate ambitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you are not receiving the green that you desperately want. But as in WORDLE, the game is still <strong>winnable </strong>until the sixth chance is made, and as in life, your goals are still achievable until your last breath is made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By consistently learning from our previous tries and making the best possible next step, achieving our greatest of aspirations will become an inevitable fact, it will become our <strong>destiny. </strong>We will reach there no matter what, and no matter how. As long as we make the all-crucial first try, as long as we are constantly learning, there is nothing to stop us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could be that someone else reached a similar goal to yours in fewer tries. But that comparison, while incredibly easy to fall into, will always prove as an utterly <strong>pointless</strong> act. What we need is a tunnel-vision focus on our own growth, our own learning curve, and our own catalog of <em>tries </em>which will definitely lead us to reach our own sense of success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I would like to say:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When life gives you <strong>black</strong> letters, learn from it until you make em all green!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The key takeaways of The WORDLE Philosophy:</strong><strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Making the <strong>first</strong> try is more important than making the “perfect” try.</li><li>Learn from your attempts. Evaluate what you did <strong>black </strong>and wrong, what you did <strong>green </strong>and right, and what you did <strong>yellow </strong>and could be better.</li><li>Consistency is <strong>key</strong>. Keep learning and keep trying, making each next step the best step yet, all towards reaching your ultimate goal.</li><li>And last of all, don’t stop until you make em all <strong>green!</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>When summarized like such, it does seem not too hard to inculcate, does it? That is because it isn’t!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most astonishing fact is that countless of us who already take part in WORDLE daily, are already using this philosophy to <strong>win </strong>daily. We just need to mirror this in our actual lives! (Easier said than done, I know. But take the first try and see the difference)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, what I want to ask all is this;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many of my fellow readers are going to adopt <strong>The WORDLE Philosophy?</strong> What goals are you willing to achieve through this? What else can we learn from this simple word puzzle according to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoot away in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the end of my post, I would leave you all with a befitting quote from the great <strong>John C. Maxwell.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The more you do, the more you fail. The more you fail, the more you learn. The more you learn, the better you get.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you stay safe and have a great life ahead 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1768\" data-permalink=\"http://thoughtsofahuman.home.blog/2022/05/14/the-wordle-philosophy/img_20220405_105054__01-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220405_105054__01-02.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"3683,2072\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.7","credit":"","camera":"ONEPLUS A6010","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1649155855","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.25","iso":"1000","shutter_speed":"0.03030303030303","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"The WORDLE Philosophy\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>The WORDLE Philosophy</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220405_105054__01-02.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220405_105054__01-02.jpeg?w=1024\" src=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220405_105054__01-02.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1768\" srcset=\"https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220405_105054__01-02.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220405_105054__01-02.jpeg?w=2048 2048w, https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220405_105054__01-02.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220405_105054__01-02.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://scholarlyscribblerhome.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220405_105054__01-02.jpeg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>A sketch by the author</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>I hope this elaborate post instills grave thought among my readers, and makes one realize what monumental things we can learn to inculcate by observing seemingly mundane happenings of our lives.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you like this post then please leave your claps and thoughts in the comments below.

        "content": "\n<p>               Anxiety, ADHD, and social isolation.<br>Wow, we really know how to pick them, huh?<br> <br>Well, more often than not, we make ADHD seem cool and people seem to want to have it because of how it’s been looking, so here’s one of the downsides.<br> <br>Stick with me?<br>*holds a hand out in dramatic fashion.*<br> <br>I have a problem. It’s not big as the other problems in the world, like global warming and the insanely high depression and suicide statistics, but it’ll do.<br> <br>I am uncomfortable in social situations. If you’ve met me in person, you’ll see that unless you ply me with happy juice and/or involve me in the conversation yourself, I will stick to my phone.<br> <br>It’s not like I can’t do it. I have amazing social skills. Most of you reading this, we’ve interacted. Could you tell that I was quaking in my office pants? No? Exactly.<br> <br> Believe it or not, I have been feeling less present for a while now. Maybe like seven, or eight years.<br>What? I did say it was a while…<br>The worst has been in the last two years though.<br> <br> <br>I like to take up space, sure. But only in comfortable spaces. I am not a fan of parties. Or large gatherings. Seeing up to 30 people at once will send me into sensory overload, and I’ll end up stuck, looking at maybe 5-10 people. The rest will fade out, or not register in my head.<br> <br>It gets worse. I used to be more comfortable on the internet because half of y’all will never see me, and I was okay with that. Screen to screen interaction. It was safe, I didn’t have to worry about nuances, body language, and tone. None of that.<br>When I took pictures, like the ones currently on my Instagram, I’d have no issues sending them to my friends, without them asking.<br>You’d open your phone and see 7 attachments from me, pictures/videos. Just because.<br> <br>Now, I have withdrawn. I cannot handle texts or friendships, I don’t send anyone pictures of me unless explicitly asked because who in the name of all things wise and beautiful is stepping on anyone’s toes?<br>Not me.<br>I am invited to outings, and I don’t show up. My stims can be embarrassing. It can be exhausting.<br> <br>I see people – like 10 at once and I don’t learn their names because I have no plans of knowing them. Because again, the topic. Social isolation.<br> <br> <br>What does that have to do with having ADHD and Anxiety?<br>The anxiety part is obvious. But whatever you have in mind? Intensify it. I don’t do anything small.<br> <br>I am hyperactive, inattentive, and impulsive. I face social rejection, and I have terrible interpersonal relationships. I feel disconnected from family members and colleagues who don’t understand my challenges. And I feel too ashamed to ask for help.<br> <br>There is a permanent sense of being alone with my challenges. Many ADHDers I know have lived in isolation as a way of protecting themselves from the misunderstandings of others and the familiar experience of rejection they have known growing up.<br> <br>We’re “too intense” and “dramatic”. Honestly, people tell me all the time it’s exhausting. They say I’m exhausting. Like I chose to have such a stupid brain.<br>Not their fault either; there are just better ways to communicate it.<br> <br> <br>So to be less exhausting, I become small. Absent, a ghost.<br>Most people have never heard me nag about being depressed. It’s dumb stuff like school stress (lmao, August 1?) and being called all the time when I’m out.<br>Petty stuff, as discussed in the last episode.<br>Okay, maybe not so petty; homophobia, any queerphobia in 2022 is embarrassing. Fix up.<br>But you only hear me riled up about these things.<br> <br>To be less in people’s faces, I limit my excitement rants. What I would have said in 29 texts, I say in 1. This one time-<br>No, we don’t talk about that time.😂<br> <br>I don’t send pictures, I don’t text first, I say please and thank you and consistently ask if I’m being a bother with my broadcasts (for this exact blog you’re reading, it’s off a BC). I consistently ask partners, “is there anything I do that annoys you?”<br>And tell me that if you lived your life on your toes like me, you’d be excited about human interaction.<br>It’s okay, lie to me.<br> <br>I’ll still be a social butterfly when you see me, of course. I speak well, and I read and update my vocabulary and brain often so I can keep up in conversation. But I get tired so fast. So easy.<br>So no, I don’t go out.<br>No, I don’t like most people in my space, my home, my room.<br>Most sha.<br>There are some people that if I was running away, they’d have ways to reach me, just them. Some people make me so comfortable, that I’d leave my home, my space just to see them. There are people I’d talk to every day and I’m okay with complimenting and sending random memes and shit. They are not intrusive. No pressure. Just me, how I come.<br> <br>What? They’re comfy.<br> <br>No offense to you people that aren’t. You’re just… pressure.<br>It’s possible you in particular aren’t, I also have text blindness.<br> <br>Sha, ADHD makes me isolate because masking is hard and I’m terrible at doing it for more than an hour.<br>  <br>Isolation is a beautiful thing, and I love the freedom it has.<br><br>Every two to five weeks I get this urge to leave social media and just vanish from everything. I feel I do this because I get overwhelmed by everything. It’s ridiculous. Sadly, I can’t get my wish, my work is on social media plus how do Desire and I communicate on topics to write?<br><br>I am not very comfortable in social situations and I lack basic social and communications skills, it might come of as rude sometimes. For the 7th million time, you don’t have to touch me to get your point across to me and I don’t want to hug you. Stop stretching your hands out. Yes, I’m uncomfortable in situations where people touch me.<br><br> If I’m being honest, I’d rather be alone and listen to Lana del Rey’s Norman Fucking Rockwell for the 9 billionth time than go to a party. If I do go to the party, I know I’ll be psyched for five mins and would immediately want to be left alone. I would probably leave the people I came with, go somewhere and watch them have fun, cos, that shockingly feels better.<br>It’s this same reason why I struggle making new friends and talking to strangers because a part of me doesn’t want to be where I am, so don’t talk to me; I want to go home. 😭<br><br>On a more serious note, though, social situations give me anxiety and 70% of the time I’m focusing on the shiny object behind the person talking to me or I’ve probably just zoned out and I’m staring you dead in the eyes and I have no idea what you’re saying. I’ll sprinkle a few “oh” and “mad mad” in between but walahi, I don’t know what you are saying. Also, being bad with remembering people’s names makes me feel kinda like an arse cos my name is difficult to pronounce, so somebody remembering my name and pronouncing it right while I’m like “ your name is Tobi yeah?” doesn’t really do so much to help my brand.<br>Also, I find talking to people kinda exhausting in some situations; just shut up already, I don’t care, walahi I don’t.<br>This probably makes me seem like a bad person, cos I mean, I’m not that good a person, but still-<br>I-<br>I don’t know.<br>I feel like a part of me intentionally tries to sabotage friendships and stuff because I’d rather be alone and enjoy my company than go out and do something with a bunch of people I don’t know. Hence why I try to be in my space and push people out of it at any chance I get.<br> I still wouldn’t let you hug me sha, gimme a fist bump instead. Good!<br><br>Back to Desire I guess.<br><br>First of all, Ameer jokes too much. Let me move to hug you and you bring your fist. I’ll deck you.<br><br>But, I completely agree with everything he’s saying. That’s the anxiety aspect I assumed you knew earlier, and if you didn’t, well, now you do.<br><br>Do you think having energy is easy? It really isn’t.<br>How do I fix it?<br> There is nothing to fix. <br> It’s perfectly okay for me to not be in the mood for association sometimes. But I do appreciate the people who continually reach out and check in.<br> <br>Plus I do that thing y’all call seeking attention, lmaoo. “I’ll be off/ unavailable for a while. If it’s urgent, call.” And I text people I was in conversation with. Tell them I’ll be away, offer a means to contact me.<br>That way, no one is unnecessarily worried or scared that I’m unaliving lol<br><br>Still, I communicate that I simply need a break.<br>I’m very dramatic, but I know there ARE spaces in which I’m important, fundamental. I’d never leave any of those people or spaces without adequately informing those affected.<br><br>Also, if that has been your concern the last six weeks, I’m fine. I just need some time away. That’s if you didn’t hear me the first seven times I said it. My social/ everything battery is really low and I’m going through things I don’t understand.<br><br>Enjoyed this episode? Or not?

        "content": "\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">I like to solicit ideas for posts from others. It gives me insight as to what is on the minds of others around me. While I have a list of ideas written in a notebook; various topics I want to tackle at some point, I am intrigued what others are thinking and what they may want to see me write about. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">The topic for this post is actually combining two ideas into one post, since I think we can gain valuable lessons from the last couple of years. The ideas come from two friends of mine; one being my former boss while I worked at the Code Blue Emergency Shelter in Saratoga Springs, New York. Those friends are Melanie Covell and Cheryl Ann Murphy-Parant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">As a society, culture, people, and individuals, we have had a lot thrown at us in just two years. We endured loss and separation due to Covid, we grew accustomed to seeing family members through video-chat instead of gathering together in homes. We wore masks in public. Many of us really learned the true meaning of loneliness. Anxiety and depression rose, drug use and alcohol consumption increased, and mental health declined for many. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">But there were some things that came out of the last two years, and which if it wasn’t for everything we tackled together, I feel would still be lost. Things like eating dinner together as a family, cancelling elaborate family vacations and instead spending more intimate and quality time together doing smaller things, and in many households, rediscovering family game night. We shopped local and supported small-businesses.  We had our children home full-time and had the opportunity to be more engaged in their education and learning. We took walks as a family, and discussed things that mattered to each other. We learned what it means to be thankful for the smallest of things. Remember the great toilet paper shortage of 2021?  We came out of the last two years thankful. We focused on the simpler things in life, and realized that life can change rapidly and without notice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Thankful. Prior to the events that have occurred in the last twenty-four months or so, thankful was a word normally confined to the month of November. You don’t typically see social media posts or hear people say that they’re thankful for little things, except for around Thanksgiving. Then everyone is thankful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">Since I started this post and shared how I worked at the Code Blue Emergency Shelter, I’m reminded of some of the guests I had the privilege of working for. Yes, I worked for them, because for the colder months here in upstate New York, the shelter was their home and I was a guest in their home. I’m reminded of so many individuals and how thankful they were for a hot meal on a frigid cold night. I think of their faces when they were given a warm jacket or new gloves. I’m reminded how many of them would step up and help clean because they were thankful they had a place to sleep that night; a warm cot and blanket rather than a cold park bench or the stairs in a parking garage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\">What are you thankful for today?  What have you learned over the last two years?  I pray we never have to endure some of the sorrow and separation that we seem to be past now, again in our lifetime. But I also pray that we take the lessons we learned and pass them on to the next generation. </p>\n",

Or Entrepreneurship endeavours… </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">How are you gonna become a millionaire if you don’t take a cold shower?</p>— Alexander Cortes PhD, Fitness, Nutrition, Fat loss (@AJA_Cortes) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AJA_Cortes/status/1434656716378021890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 5, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wim Hof et al. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-improvement is masturbation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One reason lies in the circuit trap created from the momentum that results in needing the next habit to fall in to. Once you master one – you should <em>move on.</em> <strong>If it doesn’t transfer then it is masturbatory momentum. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The effects of cold showers are mental and physical – and they transfer. Unlike the kind of yoga that allows you some social scene with the model mums and mid-level earthy-trance chicks. You can sleep with your yoga teacher but most of the benefits of this self-improvement practice should transfer beyond the mat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The physical effects of yoga and cold showers are boring – But what if cold showers transferred <em>spiritually?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This came together for me when reading <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People </em>(now realising to be more fun to read than reading just the title) and after watching Julien Himself mention the practice: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCZdJiGSk8g&t=5846s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCZdJiGSk8g&t=5846s</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We set ourselves up to see the <em>cold </em>as being against <em>I</em>… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I waddle to the shower. I turn it on. I brace. Linger. Do the pussy-step side-to-an-fro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a wasteful amount of time I barrel through. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any intense and tense moment in our lives this can be how we “handle situations”. We push ourselves through it. Force ourselves into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like “traumatic episodes” there is a moment where someone will see themselves from the outside. This is an extreme example of the split in character that has resulted in social conditioning. Ever since you were old enough to see you as being different to another noun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intense situation. We push ourselves out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cold water. We brace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scary movie. We tense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t truly frighten an enlightened Zen monk.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"296\" data-permalink=\"https://theantisimulation.wordpress.com/2022/05/14/the-reason-to-be-taking-cold-showers/0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760/\" data-orig-file=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"564,705\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760.jpg?w=240\" data-large-file=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760.jpg?w=564\" src=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760.jpg?w=564\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-296\" width=\"344\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760.jpg?w=344 344w, https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760.jpg?w=120 120w, https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760.jpg?w=240 240w, https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0dcae2210a2bce0c24eb3a45e6e60760.jpg 564w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When we are triggered by social stimulus we must not push through by pushing ourselves into a different happy place. Often there is no way of <em>not getting triggered</em>. You can train yourself to be untriggered and not crumble into a fearful cowering hunched appearance upon seeing your smoke-show of an ex-. You could look at her new low-fi-porn interweb feed shots and practise what smooth punch lines you’re going to deliver that night at the evening event and when and how you’re going to deliver them and you can even chase vodka with more vodka and slap your face and get hyped and get swole… But what if she has a smoke-show friend? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You haven’t trained for this… </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a problem of domain-specificity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you go to another place in “intense” situations you are pushing yourself out of reality. You are not whole. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the Narrator in Fight Club. Tyler Durden is the “other place” that we go to. Where we want to be and Who we want to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One must realise that by tensing up. Barrelling into a situation. Psyching ourselves up. Throwing on that Eminem before we fight… We are training ourselves to be split in character and place. We are further conditioning ourselves to be tense and separate. Not One. Whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is the real reason to be taking cold showers? The real solution to social “anxiety”. It is not “dealing” with them but <em>dissolving </em>into them. Any kind of tenseness. Feel it. Then let it go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walk into the cold shower. Calmly. Slowly. <em>Feeling it and the sensations of your body.</em> It’s only cold if you say it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the opposite of “desensitisation”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get triggered by a stimulus. Deliberately. Then use that <em>liberty </em>of the present moment to go into it. You then have freedom to choose. Not be fragile to the situation – to each moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What you are aware of, you are in control of; what you are not aware of is in control of you.” – De Mello. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seek to dissolve that inner split of consciousness and feeling. <em>Feel it</em> instead. When practising this you can dissolve the divide of who you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this all a metaphor? Obviously. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you should still be taking cold showers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you wake up. It is not even a decision. There is only one tap. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is already decided. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flow into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"297\" data-permalink=\"https://theantisimulation.wordpress.com/2022/05/14/the-reason-to-be-taking-cold-showers/0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd/\" data-orig-file=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"564,846\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd.jpg?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd.jpg?w=564\" src=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd.jpg?w=564\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-297\" width=\"394\" height=\"591\" srcset=\"https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd.jpg?w=394 394w, https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd.jpg?w=100 100w, https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd.jpg?w=200 200w, https://theantisimulation.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/0ff776a54f6fc5e4954b20ca834270cd.jpg 564w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>All phenomena are interdependent.

        "content": "\n<p>Depression isn’t always a dark negative mindset.  Sometimes it’s more of a loss of interest in the world outside, and an excessive need to just be alone.  You might not even feel so miserable; sometimes it feels like nothing more than a faint fuzzy hum lingering in the backdrop of your mind- lulling you inward and away from the racing world around you.  Awake, aware, but not entirely there.  Nothing may be apparently wrong, but nothing is quite right either.  Another interesting conundrum of the elusively fucked up magnificent human mind.  Perhaps it’s not depression at all.  How we love to try to label everything. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Into the Void</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we try to dig into this obscure feeling, connecting the mental dots as we attempt to extract the roots from this dark spell.  But, sometimes what we think is wrong is just a figment of our own imaginations.  We are just so used to something being wrong that when there is nothing, we create something.  When our minds are oddly calm, and there is nothing to be upset about, we stir the silence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there is always something to be discovered deep within our thick skulls, sometimes there is more to be discovered within the void beyond those thoughts.  This faint fuzzy hum is calling you, guiding you, teaching you.  Listen and allow.  There is no need to figure everything out.  Sometimes we are just drawn away from the crowds so that we can take the time to truly connect and unveil the truth we have been seeking about ourselves.

        "content": "\n<p> Cleo Dunsmore Buchanan and Archangel Michael</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>I asked beloved Michael this morning, “<strong>Please beloved angel, will you tell me, is it better to be tough or supportive in the presence of weakness? I know many who are hamstrung by the tough love they have received in their lives. And I know others who never fly because they have been supported always and have no interest in risk. Please how do we know whether to be tough or to be supportive?</strong>“</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael answered, “Of course this question is dear to your heart. You suffer from this injury. Who has hurt you child with their rough attitude and treatment recently? You know it is your own doing. Your interpretation of events creates the injury in yourself. You see this clearly now. So why ask the question? Do you seek to blame others?”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>“<strong>Beloved angel, no. I am wondering how I should be behaving. When am I doing right and when am I being crippling when all I wish to do is love and support?</strong>“</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>“You are sensitive, and I ask you to consider something. What if your journey and their journey are intertwined? And each kindness and each frustration is a mutual experience? How great is your benefit when they have a breakthrough? How great is their benefit when you have a breakthrough? I see you struggle unnecessarily with this! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many times we believe our actions lead to certain outcomes. But it is not so. The collective is creating as well. You are not in control of the outcome. There is light all around you and all around them. Each of us is a conduit of our own vibration of light. When these come together there is brilliant synergy! There is wild growth and joy! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see you creating such in your life! I see you trusting and launching into these connections! I love this! It is joyous to behold! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However you carry this malaise, that the outcome is your responsibility. This is not so. You are part of a creative collective which fashions an experience together. There is joy in this discovery. You are not the only one creating here. It is a group responsibility.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>“<strong>Beloved angel, I don’t understand. </strong>“</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>“Cleo, don’t you trust me to lead you well? This is great wisdom I offer you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>“<strong>Beloved, I am just asking! I don’t see how this is an answer. It doesn’t address- what happens when we must choose between support and leaving them in the cold to find their way? How can we navigate this and find benefit instead of misunderstanding and harm? It seems to me impossible- everyone’s answer must be different.</strong>“</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>“What if it is? Your answer only you are aware of and you must constantly be aware of this and take care of it yourself. How do you get support when you need it? When do you strike out on your own and find your own strength? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You yourself are very capable of finding this balance yourself. You ask for help when you need to. You seek reassurance when you need to. You are fully aware that this dynamic can be stifling if it is not fed and nurtured with independent successes. And you seek them out when you need to, correct? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must trust the universe. We are all here to complete this dynamic in unity. When we are part of the collective experience and everyone finds their strength, it benefits everyone tremendously. You are only opening these doors now. You have had all kinds of successes for yourself, alone. Now you are free to discover what it can mean to have this joy together, in ensemble. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleo I think this question is brilliant. And as a mother you must feel the importance of it. Yet we are all individuals responsible for our path through life. We choose how to go and how to see every experience. We author every moment whether we know it or not.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Thank you beloved angel!</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4>Blessings!</h4>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Confessions of a Serial Interviewer by Steven Ra Ga</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No body likes rejection. It hurts. But one thing to remember is not take it personally. It helps to brush it off and keep going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the creation of job posting websites it’s become increasingly convenient for employers to pass on your application. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The typical indeed response goes like “Unfortunately we found the right candidate for this position” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I often wonder why they say that? Like it’s unfortunate they chose the right person for the position? Like how does that person feel? “Hey man you were unfortunately selected for this role.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you get that personal email from HR explaining away why you weren’t picked which often feels like they are trying to not feel guilty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or sometimes you never hear back, the follow up to find out the chose someone else. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally can take rejection easily except when talking to women that shit never gets easy. I remember when I was single I would be terrified of asking a girl for their number in a cold call situation IRL. Online it was easy I developed a whole recipe for success. The perfect sales pitch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is rejection really though, I think it’s just another person telling you no, which dates back to when you were a kid and a parent would tell you no, that trauma, which may have been from a loving place, stuck with you as you aged. So when someone would reject your resume, idea or love advancement you could possibly project the feelings of your parents on to these people which is why it hurts so much when you get rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, a letter of rejection from a job is meaningless, it holds no weight or volume to how I see myself, like junk mail that just needs to recycled or burnt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I got rejected and felt like maybe I would share the response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a while back I decided to apply to some stores to sell my hobby art. I make creative jackets and furniture by up cycling them, that stated I have found the sales cycles to be long and difficult, utilizing other stores to sell my product in a department store model has been lightly successful… here is a response from one of the stores…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>First of all, we apologize it took us so long to get back to you and thank you for your patience. We also want to thank you so much for your interest in selling your creations with [Blank], as well as the time it took to submit your application. We know your brand means the world to you and appreciate you sharing it with us, we are always blown away by the talent in our community! </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We received hundreds of applicants in the last few months with interest to sell in one of our 4 shops and although we wish we could work with everyone, we just don’t have the space. </strong><strong>With that said, a lot of our categories are currently full and your products fall among them so we u</strong><strong>nfortunately at this time are not able to accept your brand into our shops. This is not at all a reflection of your brand and we want to encourage you to continue your love for your creative journey. After all that’s what this is all about, (we think). Keep creating, keep growing and most of all love what you’re doing.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We thank you again, we wish you all the best and keep up the amazing work! We do encourage you to apply again in a few months as things are always changing. In the meantime we are now offering workshops and pop up space, you can find more details here</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I it always feels like they are trying to cross all their T’s and dot their i’s when this kind of long winded response comes through. As though I am not busy enough, Now I have to read a novel why you said no rather than just simply saying no. And I know it’s because most people have difficulty saying the word no, so rather than saying just No there is always that long winding reason why it’s a no, so you don’t ask more questions…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some times I feel like asking why just to get a response from the person who said no, to see if I can goat then into a hard no. Usually doesn’t work, sometimes I can befriend them in the process so it because like a forced awkward friendship, where you make plans to meet them for coffee then ghost them with a long winded response why meeting them isn’t high on your list of priorities between getting gas for your car and getting your hair cut. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks like I got another one…</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\" style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Hello</strong>,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unfortunately, [Blank Company] has decided not to move forward with your application at this time.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>While we wish we had better news, continuing to search and apply for jobs will help you maintain your momentum. Best of Luck!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, time to send out a few resumes… </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

One day, her teenage son experienced a seizure and she began to worry about what else could happen? How do you keep going and continue loving and caring when you don’t know what will happen next?</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">My Thoughts:</span></h3>\n<p>I imagine most of us have experienced that feeling of helplessness and anxiety and worry over the ones for whom we are responsible. I know I have. In fact, if you are a fan of the <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/this-is-us\">NBC drama This is Us</a>, a scene in one episode touched me profoundly. Randall is at the cabin working and has visions/imaginary conversations with Jack about his anger toward Rebecca for keeping the truth about his bio father from him…..Jack encourages Randall to see the situation from Rebecca’s perspective. Through the window, Randall glimpses a frantic Rebecca closing and locking all the windows and doors in an effort to keep her family safe. So moving. A perfect picture of how I felt as a parent of a growing family…..so many worries and dangers to keep at bay.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><em><strong>“It’s true. There will always be threats lurking under the water where we play, danger hiding in the attic and rolling down the street on heavy wheels, unexpected explosions in our brains and our hearts and the sky. There will always be bombs, and we will never be able to save everyone we care about. To know that and to try anyway is to be fully alive. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The closest thing to shelter we can offer anyone is LOVE, as deep and wide and as in as many forms as we can give it.</span>“</strong></em></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Philpott shares honestly how her anxiety was triggered as a parent. Isn’t it helpful knowing others have felt the same? Experienced the same? I think the book is relatable for parents or anyone who experiences episodes of anxiety or worry.</p>\n<p>Philpott’s writing style and reflections are conversational, engaging, mostly light-hearted, and sprinkled with humor.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended</strong> for anyone who experiences anxiety and/or worries.</p>\n<p><strong>Content Considerations: epilepsy, anxiety</strong></p>\n<p><strong>My Rating: 4 Stars.</strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"96\" data-permalink=\"http://readingladies.com/about/twinkle-twinkle-little-star/\"

Beginnings<br />\n</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">My Summary:</span></h2>\n<p>Shauna Niequist’s carefully and thoughtfully cultivated life as she knows it falls apart after her fortieth birthday. What do you do when your entire life has revolved around your father’s church and your life-long, close-knit community of family and friends all collapse when your father is accused of inappropriate behaviors at his mega-church and resigns (not detailed). What happens when the happy and secure life in the mid-west you’ve dreamed of and carefully built falls apart around you? Well….you might move to Manhattan and rethink everything.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\">My Thoughts:</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I suspect most of us can relate to a life that isn’t at all what we expected or dreamed about. We may face unexpected financial problems, toxic relationships, family disappointments, broken friendships, health concerns, etc. What then? What happens when all you want to do is quit? Does everything fall apart or can we learn to live in a new way, make adjustments, gain new perspectives, forgive, show compassion, navigate heartbreak and grief, and accept unknowns? Can we rebuild, refocus, and retool?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><span style=\"color:#0000ff;\"><em><strong>“…Life is…interconnected and multifaceted. We carry around our whole selves…our past and our parents, our loves and our limitations our dreams and our grocery lists, and our wounds.”</strong></em></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I need to note:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not all of us have the option of relocating and starting a new life, have access to vacation homes, or can take a year off work to pull ourselves together. Nevertheless, she has some good things to share!</li>\n<li>Some readers are frustrated that Niequest never shares the nature of the issue with her father and the church that motivated her memoir. Her intentional vagueness is out of respect for her father’s privacy….and really the issue is her dad’s to write about….she’s sharing how her life changed and how she adjusted to those changes as a result of what happened. I had followed the news story when it came out, so her vagueness didn’t bother me. He’s easy to google if you’re interested (<a

It is a workbook, named <em>Love Your Life Workbook: Over 120 exercises to design a life you love</em> by Ayesha Ratnayake. Last year, Ayesha reached out to me about her book <em>Cheat Sheets for Life: Over 750 hacks for health, happiness and success.</em> It was a great non-fiction book, with bite-size pieces of practical advice on how to carve out your best life as possible (you can read my review <a href=\"https://felixfelicitatedblog.wordpress.com/2021/01/27/arc-book-review-11-cheat-sheets-for-life-over-750-hacks-for-health-happiness-and-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The <em>Love Your Life Workbook</em> has everything you need to reflect on your time and life and get the best out of it. There are numerous exercises to do. The author, Ayesha Ratnayake, has laid down all the groundwork and all you have to do is take some time and fill them honestly. It is a great way to reflect on yourself and seek self-improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I was also happy with the exercises. Several of them are quite innovative, such as writing your eulogy. I also liked worksheets exploring the concept of Ikigai, figuring out your dream job, habit ideas and habit trackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The book is a clear idea of short and effective ideas woven together to produce positive outcomes. It is practical and can be done more than once. I suggest doing so annually to keep track of your life and improve yourself in the long run!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">My Rating</h3>\n\n\n<div

This web of universal intelligence is what I’ve been examining with these writings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:900;\">The topic for this specific exploration is going to be the Imagination and our connection to it.</h4>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-medium\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1779\" data-permalink=\"http://amariespeaks.com/2022/05/13/the-imagination-connection/prisoner-gae894f371_1920/\" data-orig-file=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/prisoner-gae894f371_1920.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"prisoner-gae894f371_1920\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/prisoner-gae894f371_1920.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/prisoner-gae894f371_1920.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/prisoner-gae894f371_1920.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1779\" srcset=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/prisoner-gae894f371_1920.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/prisoner-gae894f371_1920.jpg?w=600 600w, https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/prisoner-gae894f371_1920.jpg?w=150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It seems, the imagination is one of the more inverted and distorted physical faculties, senses, systems (whatever you prefer to envision it as). The societal structuring in place does everything in its power to stomp it out, dilute its strength and/or embarrass/discredit any and all of those who know the undeniable, underlying truth of the imagination connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m of the opinion that every thing happens for a reason and that this world is set up in the present model for some purpose, and therefore, I conclude that the suppression and retardation of the imagination (AND <em>all types of free form thought</em>) is intentional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then what the absolute intention <strong>IS</strong> here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:100;\"><em>Well, that’s a trick question and I’m finally wise enough to see the slight of hand taking place during the illusion.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>The absolute intention is and will always be</strong> (for now) <strong>beyond my personal knowledge base, as well as outside the general scope of my current understanding </strong>(and all or most of humans fall into this category, I’m sure of that) <strong>and so, the lesson learned becomes not to waste your precious space/time digging in rabbit holes which have no use for you in the end.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">From my present perspective of hindsight I see that the real path to finding that truth is inwards only. The only spectrum of reality you can affect, alter or experience directly is your own personal sphere – and so, again – it comes back to acknowledging where the true work needs to be done; inside you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chasing your own tail in external matters like conspiracy theories and gossiping drama about people you “know” is pretty pointless except that it points out to the Self there is a lot of internal shadow resonating with these negative outside things – calling to be addressed, seen and dealt with. The bigger your inner shadow – the stronger your pull to external relations that feel the same will be. This is how you speak with your universe – its a language of frequency and energetic intention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you can expose that trick and call it for what it is, the true internal work can begin.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-medium\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1776\" data-permalink=\"http://amariespeaks.com/2022/05/13/the-imagination-connection/psychology-g972bee5ce_1920/\" data-orig-file=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/psychology-g972bee5ce_1920.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1280\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"psychology-g972bee5ce_1920\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/psychology-g972bee5ce_1920.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/psychology-g972bee5ce_1920.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/psychology-g972bee5ce_1920.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1776\" srcset=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/psychology-g972bee5ce_1920.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/psychology-g972bee5ce_1920.jpg?w=600 600w, https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/psychology-g972bee5ce_1920.jpg?w=150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Just like, as I had mentioned in the body intelligence segment, once you realize your spiritual path is internal and all about the self, then you are able to really begin building a line of communication between your brain’s mind and the body’s. It’s not until you accept yourself as is, tap into your heart center and then open up that door to your imagination space that you can actually start to sense your way through and feel out those new avenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:900;\">I’m so excited to start peeling back the layers of this individual connection to imagination because it opens the mind up to this deeper, natural communion that is continually taking place within all beings.</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The imagination is almost impossible to define, right? It’s the closest, most tangible example of infinity that we are presented with in this realm. The boundaries are ever expanding and the capabilities are always evolving so it’s basically impossible to define the imagination space – literally the same is true when we attempt to define infinity or the ether, or ‘dark matter’ or “anti-gravity”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You must step into the realm of the unknown when discussing these things and doing so should be an exciting, intriguing and inquisitive action where one remains open and unbiased, not an attitude of presumptive opinion seeking out confirmation or denial only. </strong>The latter approach, of closed mindedness is exactly how modern science and corporate science choose to monitor and promote their ‘evidence’. However, as soon as you’re awake to the inversions at play, you are able to recognize the tricks quite easily and avoid them all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoiding their fun-house style mirrors of explanations is step one – this is another way of saying what I mentioned at the start – not to go chasing your tail with external distractions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve freed yourself and want to begin creating your own reality with more consciousness then the imagination space should be your first stop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This void which we all experience is realer than the 3D world in many aspects because all things spring forth out of it. Each idea, emotion, vibration is born in the imagination then pulled down into the body’s intelligence through the soul connection – once the body has accepted the input or catalyst then reactions or responses take place in the physical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>It’s all well and good to pinpoint the processes but in the end, what does it mean? What is the purpose in my everyday life?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the stronger your connection and understanding of your own imagination is, the more clearly you can interpret the info coming in from your intuition as well as your logical mind, your bodily senses and your spirit. We humans are energetic beings and we handle a ton of sensory input processing at all times – so honing and tuning your awareness to these kinds of transfers of information is very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This monitoring and sensing of energy information transference has really helped me to build a more fluent vocabulary with my imagination and body intelligence. I highly recommend putting in the time and effort to build that bridge within your body and mind so you can develop your own unique line of communication. As I understand it, the root of all inverted or negative choice point alignments spawns from the neglect or refusal to acknowledge the source connection to your imagination or being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When posed with a catalyst the instant response sent out will shape all future possible replies – so if the frequency is one of fear, doubt, shame or some other low vibration because the entity fears the Great Unknown, well, you must understand that this collects a negative polarity in that beings field and ensures to attract and pull in like harmonies in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1781\" data-permalink=\"http://amariespeaks.com/2022/05/13/the-imagination-connection/people-gb866f57ec_1920/\" data-orig-file=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/people-gb866f57ec_1920.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"people-gb866f57ec_1920\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/people-gb866f57ec_1920.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/people-gb866f57ec_1920.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/people-gb866f57ec_1920.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1781\" srcset=\"https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/people-gb866f57ec_1920.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/people-gb866f57ec_1920.jpg?w=150 150w, https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/people-gb866f57ec_1920.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/people-gb866f57ec_1920.jpg?w=768 768w, https://amariespeakscom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/people-gb866f57ec_1920.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Beings fear the Great Unknown for many reasons – none of which seem to me of any use or benefit in the here and now space. Fear is strictly useful in dangerous situations – we all know the rationalizations out there now about evolution, the “reptilian” brain, the ancient survival instincts that modern science cites so dutifully – however, I see a rippling in their fancy curtain and therefore I conclude the window is open behind the shade They have so eloquently pulled down to deter average beings from seeing the truth. This place is a construction and there is an ‘outside’ we have been totally blinded from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The imagination is the ‘outside’ I’m referring to. It’s the organic and natural landscape of our reality. The void – the ether – the metawomb. You witness it every time you close your eyes. You can jump right into it and float for eternity, only to return right into your present moment again – if you so choose, that is. It is a bunch of non-sense and dribble if you choose to deem it as such, as well. This is the beauty of the imagination connection. You literally set the parameters for your reality and your experience in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I resonate now with Dolores Cannon’s view of the energetic training wheels and earth being a school of sorts for manifesting and working with energy. It seems to me that at least the premise is complimentary to the undeniable truths I’ve uncovered and rely on to navigate this plane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take this stance and can accept that perhaps one day you may be assessed on your journey here, the choices you’ve made, the actions and intentions you added to this place – then it becomes beneficial to your overall experience to link in and start caring about your impact, progress and feelings while you’re alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognize if your shadow has just popped up and ego is now whispering excuses or justifications into your heart. Should you so choose to dismiss the possibilities of eternal, infinite life it is your right – you are a sovereign being – however the game of life on that field you’re watching, refusing to participate in, will keep on running in over time, becoming more and more aggressive and intense, until you are forced to get off the bench and join in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you’re oriented towards self service – you may feel a different type of aversion to this line of thinking which is more like” “<em>who cares if I’m to be ‘assessed’, if this reality is all for me and my benefit well I should use it as such and I choose to disregard responsibility</em>”. Again, this is totally a personal choice and can be just as “true” as my personal perception of responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The imagination connection and your communication with the body intelligence is valuable knowledge no matter your polarity – and this is why we see so many attempts to restrict and control the flow of information around the imagination. The negative path requires its power as well – which in my opinion solidifies the undeniable truth that the imagination is how our physical bodies connect with the organic matrix here. The negative path would have no purpose for it and therefore would ignore or avoid it (as it does with positive vibrations) but it does not – it inverts and recirculates the imagination space for its own benefit – proving its original validity. Remember AI cannot create anything new. It can only pull from and work within its pre-written code – which we assume is the organic template. This fact is another heavy weight, anchoring in a type of simulation theory as a plausible origin story but I won’t get into that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 style=\"font-style:normal;font-weight:900;\">Ways to work with or tap into your Imagination Connection:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Create space for yourself and dedicate real time to your practice</li><li>Identify what sparks your curiosity, creative juices, or interest<ul><li>Always go with these things first – especially if motivation is low</li></ul></li><li>Connect with your physical body in easy, every day ways:<ul><li>write or doodle with a pen and paper often<ul><li>did you know writing with your hands actually ignites activity in special parts of your brain that are associated with logical, long term thinking processes?</li></ul></li><li>read a real book in your hands<ul><li>did you know reading not only expands your verbal vocabulary but also deepens your emotional intelligence and critical thinking, problem solving skills?</li></ul></li><li>craft, paint, knit, sew, build, tinker<ul><li>you do NOT have to be a seasoned expert to enjoy creating things and you definitely do not need to promote or show off any creation – the point is in the act of doing and feeling the moment.

        "content": "\n<p>Over the past 2 years I have been just floating along, hoping that some magical idea would sweep me off of my feet. That the fire inside would reignite and my motivation levels would soar once more. But the lesson of life is that if you are casual about life you become a casualty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting back idly and waiting for something to come along is just pure insanity. It wasn’t until about a year ago that I realized that I needed to just go for it. To start searching and see what happens. A determined curiosity to keep trying new things with the hope that something will stick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m still in that journey but I’ve realized that no matter where a path may take me it’s better than waiting for inspiration or motivation to come to me. If I don’t like something then it’s time for a change. Pivot and move on. The road is never a straight path to living a life that is meaningful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my advice to you is to go for it. Whatever peaks your curiosity. Whether it be taking a course, going back to school, learning a new skill, go for it. Too often we talk ourselves out of doing something new for the sake of comfort. Even when our current state feels uncomfortable and unfulfilling. As the clock keeps ticking away to start living a better life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what go for it because you only have one life to live. Time is going to keep moving no matter what so it’s up to you to decide how you spend it. And remember if something doesn’t work out or if the path you choose isn’t right for you then you can always move in a different direction. The key is to keep moving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me the itch to write again and blog again is simply too overpowering. To me it doesn’t matter if a single soul doesn’t read this post. It gives me a sense of calm writing and articulating my thoughts. I love it. Who knows? Maybe this is my path. Let’s see where it takes me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What path are you currently on? What paths have you taken in the past? What have you learned from them? </p>\n",

Did any of those meetings lack clarity on the goal, a lack of commitment from the participants or fail to set timelines for deliverables? If you answered yes to any of those questions, read on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My team is fully distributed. This means that the people I depend on to deliver great work are not in the same country. By default, our work is remote. And that means I need to be deliberate about teamwork and projects, if we are going to deliver on our OKRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remote offers benefits like asynchronous work schedules, and drawbacks, such as barriers to building trust. There is ample proof that both in-person and remote teams can deliver amazing work and I enjoy both modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the buzz about remote work and collaboration, the fundamentals of teamwork for in-person and remote are quite similar. After all, you and I haven’t suddenly evolved and grown wifi chips in our brains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d say remote makes it harder to hide when you’ve slacked or are not effective. Instead, the major changes are related to the tools we use, and the habits we need to work together effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever I approach a remote project, large or small, I ask myself three questions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is the deliverable?</li><li>What do I want my collaborators to contribute?</li><li>By when does it need to be done?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I then go on to have a conversation with my team about on these three items. My pitch might sound something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hi Abriya, </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To solve problem [q], I want to create [x]. It is my understanding, but correct me if I’m wrong, that you have experience with [y], which I believe can help make [x] better. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I’d like to talk with you about your possible involvement in working on [x] from the launch till the ideal delivery date of [z]. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you’re interested in project [x], I can schedule some time to discuss the details, so you can decide if this is something you want to commit to.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Best, Toby</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do I frame the question in this way? In my experience, working together well requires the team to fuel the project with three things: clarity, commitment and a timeline. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I frame the question like this, I usually receive one of these responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Is [x] the best solution?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes people want to discuss the deliverable, as they have a different idea to resolve the problem. That’s great! We can spend time redefining the problem statement and the potential solution, before moving on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Not me, but her.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes people think their experience is not relevant, but know someone else who can help. This is helpful, as I can now talk with someone who might be able to help me solve this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yes, but not now.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, people want to contribute, but cannot commit to the proposed timeline. As most timelines are artificial, this is the conversation I enjoy the most, because we can then simply figure out a timeframe for the project that accommodates both our schedules. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of collaboration is to maximize the quality of the project. I’ve found it incredibly helpful to sit down and create clarity of outcome, define what each team member will contribute, and to set clear expectations of when the work needs to be done before we start the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we agree on those three points, guiding the team to deliver on the project becomes much easier, especially while working remote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team work in general, and working remote specifically, requires a healthy mix of trust, autonomy and conscientiousness within the team. I trust them to stick to their commitments, and they trust me to stick to mine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve built that trust by consistently working together and delivering for each other, from day one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next time you have to work with a remote team, try to be clear on the outcome, explain what you expect from the team upfront, and agree on the timeline. After that, all you have to do is deliver.</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>One of my children once asked me what I would choose if I could have anything in the world. I think that if I were given that choice, my response would be “more time.” Time is the one commodity which is bestowed upon all of us equally—at least in the days that are allotted to us. It seems that we should take this most precious and scarce gift of time and invest it wisely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the keys to being productive are prioritization and organization. Set your priorities and schedule them. It’s simple in concept, but I find it to be more difficult than it sounds. It’s definitely a discipline that has to be practiced. I’ve found that ruthless time management is typically the only way I can gain some semblance of control over the time I’ve been given.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"2253\" data-permalink=\"https://thewildfrontier.wordpress.com/2022/05/14/all-the-time-in-the-world/pocket-watch/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pocket-watch.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"640,426\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"pocket-watch\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pocket-watch.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pocket-watch.jpg?w=640\" src=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pocket-watch.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2253\" width=\"516\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pocket-watch.jpg?w=516 516w, https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pocket-watch.jpg?w=150 150w, https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pocket-watch.jpg?w=300 300w, https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pocket-watch.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" /><figcaption>Image by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/bru-no-1161770/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=3179167\">Bruno /Germany</a> from <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=3179167\">Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Of course, it’s important to schedule personal time, recovery time, and family time. The point is not to become a more efficient workaholic but to get better at not <em>wasting</em> time. I tend to measure the quality of my day by how productive I’ve been. If that sounds awfully harsh, I consider spending time with my wife, kids, and friends as “being productive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A “good” day might be one in which I went to work, took the dog for a jog, paid bills, caught up on some yard work, and had a meaningful conversation with one of my kids. A “bad” day might be one in which I got no exercise because I slept in because I binged watched some Netflix show the night before, came home from work, spent an hour reading about all of the bad things that were happening in the world, then spent another hour futilely scrolling through social media, hoping to find a positive balance for the bad news I’d just read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t have much time for frivolous things. There’s definitely some goodness in that mentality, although perhaps “frivolous” things have their place. I’m a long way from achieving perfect balance in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, in trying to be as productive as possible, I’ve concluded that my priorities should be, in general, those things which have the longest-term payoff. Watching television pays off immediately. Spending time with my kids will pay off for the duration of their lifetime—and maybe their children’s lifetime. Yes, I still have to mow my lawn so we don’t get evicted. No, the dishes aren’t going to wash themselves. So “mundane” chores must be done, but it seems better to me—to the extent that I’m able—to invest my time in efforts that will be meaningful to others and to, hopefully, help manifest the deeper kingdom in the darkness of this world.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"2261\" data-permalink=\"https://thewildfrontier.wordpress.com/hourglass-1-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hourglass-1-edited.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"852,853\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"hourglass-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hourglass-1-edited.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hourglass-1-edited.jpg?w=852\" src=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hourglass-1-edited.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2261\" width=\"522\" height=\"522\" srcset=\"https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hourglass-1-edited.jpg?w=522&h=522 522w, https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hourglass-1-edited.jpg?w=150&h=150 150w, https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hourglass-1-edited.jpg?w=300&h=300 300w, https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hourglass-1-edited.jpg?w=768&h=769 768w, https://thewildfrontier.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hourglass-1-edited.jpg 852w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px\" /><figcaption>Image by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/kat7214-6502480/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=2846643\">kat7214</a> from <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=2846643\">Pixabay</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Time, for the individual, is a one-way trap door. Every moment is a decision that irreversibly affects everything which comes after—for infinity, so far as we can tell. Perhaps that’s not the case. I certainly can’t prove it, but it seems like a useful axiom by which to live. So when deciding what to do, I try to ask myself, “what is <em>the most important thing</em> I can be doing now?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we’re trying to carefully mange the precious commodity of time, we can become easily frustrated when our carefully planned schedule is disrupted by unforeseen circumstances. But there’s another way to think about disruptions. Most (perhaps all) disruptions offer an opportunity to help someone or to grow in maturity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When such an opportunity presents itself, we can become disheartened at the disruption that threatens to diminish our productivity, or we can consider that if we’re inhabiting the deeper kingdom and that eternity isn’t just an interminable future but a perpetual “now,” then we have all the time in the world to do those things which pay off forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Productivity is important. Time management is important; and time is, in one sense, a scarce commodity which should not be wasted. But when it comes to doing things that will pay off for eternity, it might be useful to remember that we also have all the time in the world.</p>\n",

It is also good to send a follow up email after a few weeks, this way it shows you are actively keeping up with submissions and it will remind them or flag your email if they missed your submission.

Showing a genuine interest and it not just being another page you want to be on, will show bloggers that you are worth their time and that you really want to be on their blog. You can also see other artists and connect with them on these blog sites and this is a great way to build relationships too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\" id=\"tip-4\">4. <strong><strong>Give information about yourself!</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-custom-size\" style=\"font-size:17px;\">When you contact the blog, send over all of your links and tell them about yourself, show who you are and not just the song you want to push. Showing who you are as an artist will grab their attention and it could lead to more features down the line. Make sure you are clear and precise when explaining what kind of music you make and what you write about, don’t tell your life story, but tell the blog enough to get to know you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\" id=\"tip-5\">5. <strong><strong><strong><strong>Make sure your socials and links are up to date!</strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-custom-size\" style=\"font-size:17px;\">5.If you are sending links and socials to blogs, it is key that you make sure they are up to date, latest images, music and reviews! Blogs will look at these links and socials and decide if they want to work with you, so make sure they look great and that they are up to date. It’s not use saying ‘My new song is out’, you send a link to your socials and your last post is a song from years ago, or the link in your bio on your socials sends you to your old song. Make sure your links are up to date and look great!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-custom-size\" style=\"font-size:17px;\">How will you use these tools and ideas in your artistry? We’d love to hear from you.</p>\n",

Yes. Was I overcompensating for my own uncertainty as to the exact venue constraints and whether this workshop could be done in an hour? Yes. Would I do it again? Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing and folding the booklets took time, but it was proportionate to the result. People enjoyed them (they were awfully cute), and said it was good to have for such a short class, and to be able to take away if they had to leave early (since it was drop-in). And <em>I </em>really liked have a physical object to give people, so I knew they left the workshop with something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest lesson for me was <strong>how useful this sort of booklet/zine/object was in planning and <em>giving</em> the workshop</strong>. It’s easy to just go wild with handouts. But this was <strong>a single, self-contained object, with a size appropriate to the length of the class</strong> (three double-page openings and a wrap-around cover — the flip-side of the paper was blank for people to use as scrap paper). It was something that constrained my natural urge to put ALL THE INFORMATION in a talk, but it was also a prop I could talk to and scale my time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might not apply to every format, but I’d like to experiment with similar (if less-illustrated) scaled handouts as a central structuring object for other workshops.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"14251\" data-permalink=\"https://tanaudel.wordpress.com/2022/05/09/brisbane-writers-festival-2022-very-brief-recap/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,848\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"2022-05-07-KJennings-MapWorkshopWhiteboard\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg?w=1000\" src=\"https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg?w=584\" alt=\"Photo of whiteboard with very scribbly fairy-tale map on it\" class=\"wp-image-14251\" srcset=\"https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg?w=584 584w, https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg?w=150 150w, https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg?w=300 300w, https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg?w=768 768w, https://tanaudel.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2022-05-07-kjennings-mapworkshopwhiteboard.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" /></a><figcaption>The whiteboard by the end of the workshop</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m adding this to my running list of lessons I’ve learned for giving workshops and presentations (see e.g. <a href=\"https://tanaudel.wordpress.com/2021/07/02/observation-journal-lessons-for-presentations-and-conferences/\">lessons for presentations and conferences</a>). I should probably do a master post at some point, but for now the main lessons I have learned (your mileage my vary) are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use a handout scaled to the workshop size.</li><li>Do an initial outline <em>very</em> quickly, before overthinking.</li><li>If a presentation is image based, arrange images in the slideshow first, print them out 9-to-a-page to keep track, then just talk to/about the pictures. Minimal script needed — often any title-slides and maybe one or two scribbled notes of phrases to remember are enough.</li><li>If a slideshow is image-heavy, export a copy to PDF and use that if the tech set-up allows — you can zoom in on a PDF in ways a Powerpoint doesn’t easily allow.</li><li>If a script is necessary, use cascading dot-points — this makes it easier to edit for time (skip up to high-level dot-points) or elaborate (by referring to the low-level ones), as well as to navigate quickly.</li><li>If it’s a creative workshop, get people making things as early as possible.</li><li>If you want people to interact, get them to share their thoughts/activities in smaller groups, then pick on the <em>groups</em> for any ideas that emerge (giving everyone safety in numbers/plausible deniability). </li><li>If possible, mixed-age workshops can be <em>great</em>. Adults mellow the kids, kids loosen up the adults, everyone seems more willing to show their work, and if you need someone to act out an implausible action for art reference purposes, young joints are better suited.</li></ul>\n",

For maybe the 100<sup>th</sup> time ever, an employee gamed a very well-designed HR policy in place at my friend’s company. As I witnessed her navigate the tightrope between wanting to penalize the employee and thanking him for bringing the loophole to light, I recalled yet another of my favorite tech terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-chaos-monkey-upgraded-1d679429be5d\"><em>Chaos Monkey</em></a><em> is a software built by those at Netflix designed to inflict pain to pressure test against unexpected, unplanned failures. </em><em>The chaos monkey deliberately switches off servers in live environments at random. It takes the pain of disappearing servers and brings that pain forward. By deliberately sabotaging their own systems, think friendly hackers, it creates strong alignment for the team to design-in redundancy and automation for the necessary resiliency and reliability in the face of random failures. Training for this randomness helps make stronger, more resilient and fault-tolerant systems and software</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In short, chaos monkey is a metaphor for actively working on what life could throw at your system before it happens. People attempt to break systems all the time. Employees do it, hackers do it, you & I are always contemplating ways to do it: it’s everywhere. The beauty of it lies in knowing how to use it to your advantage like the engineers at Netflix do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Think of it as <strong><em>‘Chaos Monkey sessions’</em></strong> where you invite a diverse set of ‘hackers’ to come together and attempt breaking an existing or new product, policy, tool or process. Maybe even award them to do so. This way, you are aware of most of the ways the system can be played and all perceivable problems before they come into play allowing you to build more resilient interventions. When I say diverse, I do not refer to just end users. Begin by pulling a diverse set of people within the HR function–recruiters, compensation consultants, learning partners. Then add in a set of non-HR roles. Once you’ve done that, identify for a cross-section of gender, differently abled, color vision deficient, neurologically different, etc. It will surprise you how much you learn when you do this. Not very long ago, I learnt that my new dashboard that took days of design and included lots of color coding was absolutely useless to one of my color vision deficient leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Sometimes, best laid plans fall apart sometimes, and that is ok. There are only two things one can do; prepare as well as you can and face failure with grace. Embracing Chaos Monkey helps prepare us. As for the employee, she’s still around and now leads these sessions.</p>\n",

A business you want to start, or a career change to something that makes you feel great about showing up to do your life’s work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to live out your big, loud, audacious goals (or, just as valid, your small, downsized, quiet, peaceful goals).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But something’s stopping you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have the time. You don’t have the knowledge. You’re not sure you can achieve it. You’re not sure you can commit to it long-term. You’re afraid of burning out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this sound like you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My free eBook will help you find that thing deep down that you’d love to be doing, and it will also help you work through the imposter syndrome and self-sabotaging negative beliefs that keep you from going for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to work on your passion every single day to make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re allowed to pace yourself and go at the speed your life allows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s my hope that this eBook will help you make a plan toward your dream, without burning out on the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button aligncenter\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link has-background\" href=\"bit.ly/stopburnoutebook\" style=\"background-color:#8163ac;\">get your copy</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong>My Four Part Framework</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My coaching work, membership program, and yes — this eBook, all rely on a framework that helps you balance four very important aspects of your goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intuition, Grounding, Pacing, and Reframing</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This eBook has exercises, journal prompts, and self-coaching tools that you can use right away to hear your inner voice, make sure your goals are grounded in reality and not hustle mode, pace yourself to work toward your deep-down dream consistently and sustainably, and reframe negative thoughts to boost your self-concept and become the person who can get all this stuff done without freaking out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a skill. You can learn it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Time management tips</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The eBook also has tons of time management tips you can customize to your needs. I’m autistic and I have ADHD, and I 100% understand that you can’t just apply a one-size-fits-all time management technique designed for neurotypical people. So try out some of my tips to help you understand how long things take, your most productive time of the day, and how to cut yourself some slack for not vibing with the 9-to-5 life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Envision the future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning for the future can feel a little scary, but making a plan gives you a horizon to move toward. It’s not set in stone. My eBook’s three year plan exercise will help you set milestone check-in points for your big deep-down dreams and goals so you can stay on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get your copy now </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you sign up for my newsletter, you’ll <a href=\"http://bit.ly/stopburnoutebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">receive your free copy of Achieve Your Dreams without Burnout</a> immediately to your inbox! After that, you’ll receive a weekly-ish email from me with motivation, tips, and life lessons to help you embrace your creativity.</p>\n",

I never knew, while i was taking the groom to the church, that i was very close to a ditch…poor me, i didn’t see it well or maybe i underrated it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiam! I got into it and the day was nearly messed up because of the unexpected sound at the rear side of the jeep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were there for close to 20mins and i was running from pillar to post, looking for stones, blocks, planks that i could use to raise the vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, ohhh sorry, we tried all efforts all to no avail and we were getting late for church.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zooooommmmm…..i just remembered that the jeep has an <strong>#auxiliary gear</strong> that can actually help in such situation…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without making any announcement on the pages and minds of anyone, i quickly entered the jeep, ran the engine and applied the auxiliary gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What would happen, you asked?

It is a workbook, named <em>Love Your Life Workbook: Over 120 exercises to design a life you love</em> by Ayesha Ratnayake. Last year, Ayesha reached out to me about her book <em>Cheat Sheets for Life: Over 750 hacks for health, happiness and success.</em> It was a great non-fiction book, with bite-size pieces of practical advice on how to carve out your best life as possible (you can read my review <a href=\"https://felixfelicitatedblog.wordpress.com/2021/01/27/arc-book-review-11-cheat-sheets-for-life-over-750-hacks-for-health-happiness-and-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The <em>Love Your Life Workbook</em> has everything you need to reflect on your time and life and get the best out of it. There are numerous exercises to do. The author, Ayesha Ratnayake, has laid down all the groundwork and all you have to do is take some time and fill them honestly. It is a great way to reflect on yourself and seek self-improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I was also happy with the exercises. Several of them are quite innovative, such as writing your eulogy. I also liked worksheets exploring the concept of Ikigai, figuring out your dream job, habit ideas and habit trackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The book is a clear idea of short and effective ideas woven together to produce positive outcomes. It is practical and can be done more than once. I suggest doing so annually to keep track of your life and improve yourself in the long run!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">My Rating</h3>\n\n\n<div

        "shorturl": "https://wp.me/pdXGX3-1f",
        "content": "\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses had remained on the same spot for a very long time while very few of them think about how to get to the next level and many do not think at all because they are comfortable with where they are; with what they are doing and the results they get!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a <strong>dynamic entrepreneur</strong>, what should envelop your mind about your business should be, <strong>How To Scale Up!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us see some things that can help us…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(1) Think through your most important tasks and responsibilities.</strong><br>This has to be done on paper.<br>Remember that the shortest pencil is better than the largest brain/memory!<br>The truth is, your memory would always fail you but once your thoughts are well written down, it gears you up for great exploits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing is, your tasks well written down with every details would help your movement and add to your growth because nothing would be missing as your go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It now come to the point of reviewing your moves carefully well so you can measure your growth. Filter and identify what works and what doesn’t work!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success they say, is in the details! As one inaccuracy can make all your efforts useless!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My question is, <em>are you sure you are capturing every detail of your thought for progress?</em> And trust no detail is missing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If none would be missing, you have to always write it down so your speed can be enhanced!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>(2) Seek out inputs and opinions of others</strong>.<br>This doesn’t mean you can’t make decisions on your own.<br>It doesn’t also mean that you aren’t the architect of your destiny nor that you lack the ability to think inside the box, outside the box, around the box or over the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is just that you do not want to take actions before thinking about them or not learning from those in the “shoes you are about to wear” or those ahead of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had come to realise this that the age of Methuselah(the oldest man in history) has nothing to do with the wisdom of Solomon (the wisest being in history). Hence the need to always consult those we know as authorities who can show us the way we should go as regards the path of our business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you want to go fast, go alone.

        "content": "\n<p>How do you get back into the writing flow when you are at a standstill? Not all tips work for everyone or are created equal. These are some that work the best for most people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do not switch between too many projects</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching between projects seems like a great idea. It can be if done right. You can’t just start a post, lose inspiration, then never come back to it. This is then an issue.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first started writing, every time I got bored a new story would be born. Then on the flip side, I stayed on one project and would not deviate until it was done. From personal experience, I find having limited projects to work on keeps me on task and more productive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, I work on editing the second draft of my current book in progress, a post to my blog, or other professional writing. Not all creatives work the same way. You as the writer will have to experiment with what is right for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Taking Breaks</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common tip seen way too much is ‘writers must write every day’. For some, this is all the motivation they will ever need to maintain focus. In reality, this does not work for all. Life happens. If writing is not your full-time job, you can take a break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you don’t have a looming deadline over your head, taking time to recharge is beneficial for your mental health or anxieties. How much time do you take? That depends on you as an individual. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For shorter pieces, a few hours is good. For a longer piece, maybe sleep on it. Either way, you can see it with fresh eyes after the break. When not crunched for time, I leave a day in between drafting and editing. Several rounds of edits with an hour or two in between also work well for some. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Other focus tips</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have a hard time working in complete silence? Do you have so much noise around you that you can’t concentrate? Background noise might help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to only be able to write in complete quiet. When I went to college, however, I had to learn to find something to tune out noisy neighborhoods. I had recently received an iPod and figured, ‘Why not drown out the noisy people with music?’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took some getting used to, don’t get me wrong. It has made me more versatile as a writer. Now I can write sitting in a crowded room with a blaring tv and not be phased when in the zone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don’t clock watch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without proper context, it does sound weird. What is meant by this is don’t look at a clock while writing. If you sit down to start writing, three hours have gone by and you still have a blank screen. That is going to frustrate you. I know it does when it happens to me!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a schedule to keep but want to write in your spare time, your smart device is your best friend. Why you ask? All smart devices have an alarm feature. Use the alarm to your advantage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set the alarm on your phone or tablet; then set it aside. Then no matter how many social media pings you hear, don’t touch that device till the alarm goes off. As someone who likes looking at memes a lot from my tablet while writing, that is easier said than done. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these tips in mind, you might surprise yourself with how much you get done without so many distractions. </p>\n",

The productive capacity of the economy is the combination of capital and labor it takes to make goods and services. If labor proves more challenging, firms can increase their capital and investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Higher productivity would solve multiple economic issues at the same time. It would increase production, alleviating some supply constraints in the economy. It would allow businesses to better afford higher wages and keep unit labor costs lower as a result. Both would be disinflationary relative to the current environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To date, productivity in the economy is not much higher than its pre-pandemic trend. Productivity increased initially, in part because firms were forced to make do. Sales were strong but the workforce was smaller. However, as employment has increased in the past year, per worker productivity has largely moved sideways, eroding some of those initial gains. Productivity in the first quarter of this year declined, although the data is noisy and omicron disrupted workplaces to a greater degree.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"18220\" data-permalink=\"http://oregoneconomicanalysis.com/2022/05/12/the-economy-could-use-better-productivity/productivity22q1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png\" data-orig-size=\"1614,1057\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"productivity22q1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png?w=1024\" src=\"https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18220\" width=\"512\" height=\"335\" srcset=\"https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png?w=512 512w, https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png?w=150 150w, https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png?w=300 300w, https://oregoneconomicanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/productivity22q1.png?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, productivity remains a key, long-run economic measure. Higher productivity would raise the speed limit of overall economic growth, and better keep inflation at bay. There are two potential bright spots that could point toward faster productivity in the years ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One, new orders for capital goods remain strong. Businesses are looking to investment in new equipment. This should make workers more productive. However, the massive increases in new orders, measured in dollars, do not look as strong on an inflation-adjusted basis. The good news is even inflation-adjusted new orders remain above pre-pandemic levels. This is at least in part due to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://oregoneconomicanalysis.com/2022/04/27/goods-production-is-strong/\" target=\"_blank\">strong sales and manufacturing production</a> overall, but could lead to better productivity moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two, new business formation remains strong. New firms are usually best able to bring new products, services, and efficiencies to the market. Should this new generation of businesses do likewise, productivity could improve in the years ahead, even as the creative destruction process results in a few more business closures along the way. To date the number of businesses in Oregon is higher than it was pre-pandemic.

Some work needs to be done alone, such as most doctoral research. Some work is sometimes best done alone, such as writing an opinion piece for a high-profile blog. But some work definitely needs to be done in collaboration. Most research benefits from collaboration. When I am commissioned to do a piece of research alone or with one other colleague, I always recommend that the commissioner set up a small group of relevant people to advise and steer the research project. And writing often benefits from collaboration too. In fact academic writing is always more or less collaborative: even if only one person is named as the author, the work will have been influenced by other scholars, colleagues, reviewers, editors – the list is long. And if more than one author is named, the work is likely to have benefited from the sustained engagement of more than one person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some work really needs collaborators. Three colleagues and I wrote <a href=\"https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/creative-research-methods-in-education\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Creative Research Methods in Education</em></a>, and it was a better book, as a result, than it would have been if any three or two of us had worked on the project. I often receive requests to collaborate with others on research, or writing or both. Sometimes they are from friends or colleagues, and I always consider those carefully. <a href=\"https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/our-research/access-our-research/find-a-researcher-or-supervisor/researcher-profile/?id=nlemon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Narelle Lemon</a> from Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia, suggested we work together on the education book when we first met in person. Sometimes requests to collaborate come from people I don’t know. The reception those ones get will vary depending on what the person is proposing and how they put that across. If the email is from a free email provider such as gmail, with lots of spelling mistakes, asking me to collaborate on research to help prove that hemlock cures cancer – and to contribute to the funding of that research – I will reach swiftly for the delete button. Conversely, if the email is from an organisational address, well written, and asking me to collaborate on work that is within one of my areas of expertise, I will respond – and if the enquirer mentions that they have a budget, I am likely to respond positively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best collaboration request I have had from a stranger came from <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/geography/people/academic-staff/richard-phillips\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Richard Phillips</a> of Sheffield University. His initial message, in July 2018, simply said: “Dear Helen, I would like to explore the possibility of involving you in a workshop on creative writing and social research, and have a budget for this. It would be great to hear from you and discuss. Thanks, Richard.” Short, to the point, and very interesting indeed. I emailed straight back, and in his reply he told me he liked <a href=\"https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/creative-research-methods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">my book on creative research methods</a>. Better and better! We spoke a couple of days later, met a couple of weeks after that, ran the workshop in November 2018, and our book on <a href=\"https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/creative-writing-for-social-research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Creative Writing for Social Research</em></a> was published in January 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find a collaborator, the most important thing is to do your homework. If you want someone to co-write a journal article about the role of manicures in ex-convict rehabilitation, you need to find someone who shares that niche interest. And when you do find someone who seems suitable, make sure your potential collaborator likes to write; not everyone does. There should be no need to introduce yourself, because the person you are contacting should be able to find information about you online; if they can’t, they are much less likely to agree to collaborate with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, people are more likely to agree to collaborate if you are their peer or above, the work you are proposing is within their areas of interest, and you have a budget. If you have nothing but passion for a project, it is still worth asking suitable people if they are willing to collaborate, but be prepared for rejection. Also, please be aware that offering to collaborate for free could put you at risk of being exploited. However much you care about an issue, it is equally important to take care of yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This blog, the monthly #CRMethodsChat on Twitter, and the videos on my </em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/HelenKaraWriter\" target=\"_blank\"><em>YouTube channel</em></a><em>, are funded by my beloved </em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/helenkara\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Patrons</em></a><em>.

        "content": "\n<p>By: Roman Insignares</p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:500;\">Homework can be a very boring and tedious task for many of us. So, it’s natural that people would not want to finish it and instead partake in their hobbies or spend time with others. Sadly, homework is something that everyone must complete no matter if they want to or not. Therefore, focus is crucial for maintaining a working environment. By following these steps, you will be more focused on your work and be able to work without constant distractions. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"has-large-font-size\"><li>Making a study space</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:500;\">Everyone has their own personal space to watch tv, be on their phone, or just relax. This is a safe space people enjoy being in. But, this space is not a study space. In fact, it is the polar opposite of one. A study space should be dedicated to work and study, not relaxation because people will be less likely to abandon their work if they’re in a place where they know that their work is there to be completed. Having a home office is immensely helpful because they would put anyone’s brain in work mode. If you don’t have a home office, you could substitute it with your living room or even your kitchen instead. It does not matter where your study space is, if its peaceful and away from distractions. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"26\" data-permalink=\"https://time7219310.wordpress.com/2022/05/12/how-to-focus-when-doing-homework/home-office-ideas/\" data-orig-file=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/home-office-ideas.webp\" data-orig-size=\"800,545\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"home-office-ideas\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/home-office-ideas.webp?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/home-office-ideas.webp?w=800\" src=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/home-office-ideas.webp?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-26\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\" class=\"has-large-font-size\"><li>Starting a schedule </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:500;\">Now you may have a study space, but is it useful like it should be? To assure the answer to this question is “yes,” you will need to start a schedule and stick to it. Without a schedule, the study space may barely end up being used as well as it could. For example, if you have work and school, those things could collide and lead to multitasking, which isn’t nearly as efficient as working on each thing at their own time. If you work from 9 am to 5 pm, make work your only objective during that time frame. People may think it would be more productive to work on a school project during work hours, but it is not because each task is not being done at its full potential. Your schoolwork will be waiting for you when you’re done so make the most out of your work time. Even if you don’t have work and only have homework, you may think doing chores in between would be effective, but it’s the same with trying to do school and work at the same time. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\" class=\"has-large-font-size\"><li>Doing away with distractions </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:500;\">The easiest way to stop your study space from being a study space is to be surrounded by distractions. Distractions are the biggest problem for someone who wants to complete their task. All distractions do is waste valuable time. Checking social media posts or having a tv show run in the background constantly, is going to make it near impossible to focus. Your brain is not going to go on auto pilot and do the work for you, so you need to respect your study time and push away these distractions. This may be hard when starting out, but if you do this enough times, you’ll see how much more productive you are. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"29\" data-permalink=\"https://time7219310.wordpress.com/2022/05/12/how-to-focus-when-doing-homework/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions/\" data-orig-file=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1767,1768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-29\" width=\"492\" height=\"492\" srcset=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions.jpg?w=492 492w, https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions.jpg?w=984 984w, https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions.jpg?w=150 150w, https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions.jpg?w=300 300w, https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/lb0128-03-working-at-home-tips-get-rid-of-distractions.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\" class=\"has-large-font-size\"><li>Taking Breaks </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:500;\">Always pushing away distractions will allow you to get more done than ever before, but this isn’t realistic. It could take a toll on your mental health if you never allow yourself to enjoy your distractions occasionally. However, this doesn’t mean when you get distracted, just drop what you’re doing and leave it as a future problem. Breaks can motivate you to complete your work because you know there’s more to your day than just homework. Having designated breaks is an effective compromise from being constantly laser focused or constantly distracted. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"27\" data-permalink=\"https://time7219310.wordpress.com/2022/05/12/how-to-focus-when-doing-homework/workday-break/\" data-orig-file=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/workday-break.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"900,400\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"workday-break\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/workday-break.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/workday-break.jpg?w=900\" src=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/workday-break.jpg?w=900\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-27\" srcset=\"https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/workday-break.jpg 900w, https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/workday-break.jpg?w=150 150w, https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/workday-break.jpg?w=300 300w, https://time7219310.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/workday-break.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></figure>\n",

Time management is necessary to be productive, especially if you have your hands in a lot of pots and children. So why not have fun will doing it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">I was always one to have a pocket planner to keep up with my life starting back in high school, but then it took the back seat once my smartphone showed me what it can do. Now that I am busier, a mom, entrepreneur, and living a fuller life all around, so the need for the planner became obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">I have researched and invested in my planning system, and it has taken me a year to finally have a system that works for me. After watching videos on Youtube and comparing all the many options online, I chose to go with the disc-bound style planner. With the versatility and styles available the choice for me was easy. This style allows me to franken-plan and pull out and refill pages as I see fit. Being apart of the industries I am in these options are game changers. Not only am I able to plan but I have also created notebooks within my planners, so everything I will need is at my fingertips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">Currently I have six planners and I know that sounds like a lot but hear me out. The first and most important planner is my catch-all desk planner. Meaning it holds everything I need. I could have stopped there, but this one never leaves home, holds all my learning notes, business ideas and all things I could need to plan my life. This one keeps me organized and is always the first planner to be updated. The second one is my business planner, and that one speaks for itself. I carry it into meetings to take notes and only business-related planning goes into it. My third is my family/homelife planner, this is the only spiral bound planner I have, and I use it for keeping up with the basics and appointments. Fourth in line is the fitness/wellness planner, which is mostly used for meal planning, moods, and workouts. Planner number five is my writing planner, in which I plot and plan my writing. It has character development, word counts, and novel outlines, with space for additional note taking. My last planner and the new addition is my faith and journal planner. I will be using it to keep up with my inner thoughts, prayer, bible study and verse of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">At one point I did have most of these planners combined and my individual count was less, but I have found it easier and more organized to have them separated. They all look different and have their own aesthetic. They are in multiple sizes and meet the needs I have for them. I am always on the look out for new things to add and diverse ways to set them up, but I am happy to have them spread out. I never thought I would be the one to enjoy having multiple planners and thought it was strange to see other people that did. Now I see the advantage and really, it is fun to set up and decorate each to my liking. I may decide to alter it at some point and reduce the amount but working from home most of the time gives me the time to indulge in decorating and taking my time to lay out all my planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">So, if you are someone looking into paper planning and not sure how to get started, I hope this helps and give inspiration to you. Franken-planning, disc-bound, spiral bound, or even just an as is planner can add real value to your life. Time management is necessary to be productive, especially if you have your hands in a lot of pots and children. So why not have fun will doing it? Let me know what your current method for planning and I might just find inspiration also.</p>\n",

        "shorturl": "https://wp.me/p4QwYD-49h",
        "content": "\n<p>If you know anything about ADHD, you know that the tools we use to keep our brains on track get a little less… shiny overtime. When I created my first <a href=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.com/2017/07/22/adhd-survival-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ADHD survival guide</a>, I knew that it wouldn’t be my last, because as ADHDers, we have to upgrade our systems on a regular basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, what I didn’t expect was that a global pandemic would bring every ADHDer I know to their knees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us began working remotely, which surely has advantages, but also happens to be the place we’re most likely to get distracted. And being confined to our homes has complicated the ways we typically separate work, play, and rest. These are new challenges even for The Neurotypicals™, but for the neurodivergent among us, this is operating on hard mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me personally, I hit a wall this past year known as “ADHD burnout.” When I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samdylanfinch/status/1509298473002168327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">talked about it on Twitter</a>, it seemed to resonate with a lot of you, too. ADHD burnout describes a cycle of overcommitting, underdelivering, and anxious-avoidance that results in shame, depression, and exhaustion for so many ADHDers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In other words? We take on too much, we procrastinate for too long, and suddenly we’re unable to do <em>anything.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the wall that I slammed head first into at my last job. And when I did, I couldn’t seem to get any work done despite my best efforts. I was done. My brain was scrambled, my boss was disappointed, and I watched everything I’d built professionally come toppling down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like a failure. And even <em>that </em>wasn’t enough to motivate me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Neither of us are failures, though.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If this pandemic has completely derailed your ability to get stuff done, you aren’t alone.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of us have relied on that last minute adrenaline and self-deprecation to motivate us in the past. And here’s an unfortunate fact about relying on adrenaline and bullying to fuel us: it was never going to be sustainable, was it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was never reasonable to expect ourselves to do everything at the last minute, and to shame ourselves repeatedly when we did, for the rest of forever. So let’s let go of that illusion, shall we? When it worked, it worked (well, sort of). But it wasn’t going to work forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And certainly not during a global trauma, my friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes sense that your tools need a refresh. Mine did, too. So I set out to do the research, again, on how to create a system that worked for me. And this time, I came up with some tools that I knew I had to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how did I manage to get my sh!t together all over again? These are the tools I used that I’m hopeful can help you, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#abb7c226;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-medium-font-size\">A quick disclaimer before we start…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I’m committed to only recommending products that <em>I’ve used myself and stand by</em>. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I do include affiliate links in this post, I was not paid to include any product on this list — I selected each of them personally because I’ve seen them work both for myself and my coaching clients!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Affiliate links are a great way to support this (free) blog, though, so I hope you’ll consider using the links provided if you decide to sign up for an app or purchase a book.

For pushing through procrastination: Centered.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t emphasize enough how much <a href=\"http://centered.app/sam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Centered</a> has helped me (and a lot of my coaching clients, too). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Centered, in short, takes your tasks for the day and turns them into a focus music playlist. There’s also a digital coach overlaid on your music, prompting you with reminders of how long you’ve been working, and gently nudging you when you navigate away from the window you’re supposed to be in. It also silences your notifications for you, to ensure you’re able to concentrate to the fullest.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"15962\" data-permalink=\"http://letsqueerthingsup.com/2022/05/11/adhd-survival-guide-pandemic/image-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png\" data-orig-size=\"1855,1358\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=1024\" src=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15962\" width=\"623\" height=\"455\" srcset=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=1024 1024w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=623 623w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=1243 1243w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=150 150w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=300 300w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Centered is designed with neurodivergent brains in mind, creating the ideal circumstances for deep work with a layer of accountability to keep you on task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Centered takes away the guesswork of “how the heck do I focus right now?” It sets you up for success by coaching you through difficult moments, and helping you organize your tasks in a sensible way. It also includes breathing exercises, reminders to look up from your screen, and so many other thoughtful details that will make your working experience more enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fcb90008;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>In short, this is for you if: </strong>You just.

For organizing my day: Sunsama</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m going to be brutally honest about <a href=\"https://sunsama.grsm.io/qaclhvjozyw8\">Sunsama</a>: I didn’t think I was going to like it. When they initially reached out to me to check out their app, <em>I ignored them for several weeks. </em>(In my defense, I get a lot of “look at this app!” emails, and they’re rarely ADHD-friendly.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looked like every other app promising that it could do everything for you. But after one too many unruly to-do lists and not really understanding how to budget my time, I decided to try it. And y’all, it’s amazing.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"15973\" data-permalink=\"http://letsqueerthingsup.com/2022/05/11/adhd-survival-guide-pandemic/image-2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"image-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=800\" src=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15973\" width=\"342\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=342 342w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=684 684w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sunsama is a daily organizer and calendar that integrates with several of the major apps people use for their workflow, including Google calendar, Gmail, Asana, Trello, Notion, Todoist, Slack, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It basically gathers all the apps you’re using, streamlines the information, and helps you build your to-do list for the week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite function is that I can check my email and calendar directly in Sunsama, and then I can <em>literally drag and drop</em> individual emails and events directly into my to-do list. No more forgetting to respond to high priority emails — it’s linked directly in my to-do list, along with all my events for the day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all in one list! It kind of rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fcb90012;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>In short, this is for you if: </strong>You’re someone that relies on a lot of different apps for your job — this is the one that will make your life ten times easier (at least). This is also for you if you rely on a to-do list to get things done, but need help organizing your time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>It’s about ~$20 a month, which is pricier than some other to-do apps (but they often have much fewer integrations and capabilities).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I’m an affiliate! </strong>If you’d like to support this blog while supporting yourself, sign up <a href=\"https://sunsama.grsm.io/qaclhvjozyw8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using this link</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. For creating accountability: Focused.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting out of bed in the morning and starting my day is the hardest part of ADHD, at least for me. So when I heard about <a href=\"https://www.focused.space/wakeup-weektrial\">focused.</a>, I knew I had to try it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focused, an online community for accountability, has been immensely helpful in shaping my mornings. Focused offers several morning meetings in different timezones for members to sign onto, offering direct planning support to those of us who need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each morning, you’ll join a community of focusers to meditate, set your goals for the day, and block off time on your calendar to complete your tasks. You’ll then have the option of sending your goals to a group facilitator, who will email you at the end of the day to see if you’ve completed your goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also focused work sessions, where folks join and turn cameras on to work alongside each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, it’s a supportive, thoughtful, and caring community. And as a freelancer who doesn’t answer to a manager, having the extra layer of accountability has been a huge help in getting me going every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fcb90012;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>In short, this is for you if: </strong>You thrive from direct accountability and working alongside others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>For $29 dollars a week, you get access to the wakeup calls as well as the focus sessions. I personally think the buy-in is important to ensure that you show up and take full advantage of the membership, and it helps support the amazing team that runs the calls!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Oh cool, a bonus! </strong><a href=\"https://www.focused.space/wakeup-weektrial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Using this link</a>, you can get your first week for five dollars!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. For keeping a routine: Routinery</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"15966\" data-permalink=\"http://letsqueerthingsup.com/2022/05/11/adhd-survival-guide-pandemic/image-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"2010,2202\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png?w=274\" data-large-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png?w=935\" src=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png?w=935\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15966\" width=\"286\" height=\"310\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The first thing that I abandoned when the pandemic hit was my routines. Which, let’s be real, weren’t very consistent to begin with. Thankfully, I’ve been able to get back on track using <a href=\"https://routinery.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Routinery</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Routinery allows you to set up a “playlist” for your routines, walking you through each task with a timer and a visual cue. The visual cues are amazing for neurodivergent brains, and the timer helps keep ADHDers on track by increasing time awareness. It also tracks your “streak” (how many days in a row you complete your routine) for some added incentive. The science behind this app is legit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally use this app to set up “basic” and “bonus” routines for morning and night. My basic routine is for when I’m low energy and just need to get the essentials out of the way. My bonus routine is for when I have more spaciousness and energy, and want to luxuriate a little more while I’m doing my routine (for example, having an elaborate skincare routine doesn’t work <em>every </em>night, but I include it in my bonus routine for the nights I do have the time!).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fcb90012;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>In short, this is for you if: </strong>You struggle to stick to a routine, and would benefit from an app that offers visual cues as you complete your routine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>There are various plans available, from $2.99 per month to $21.99 per year. You can also change your plan at any time!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. For gamifying tasks: Hatch Focus and Focus Noodles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of folks with ADHD benefit from gamified apps (put another way, apps that take our everyday tasks and make them feel like a game). Gamified timers are a great option, as they help to keep our attention on the task at-hand while offering us a reward for maintaining our focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two timers that do this well are <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hatch-focus-for-students/id1320527234\" target=\"_blank\">Hatch: Focus</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-noodles/id1492424176\" target=\"_blank\">Focus Noodles</a>. In Hatch: Focus, each block of time that you focus for results in a quirky critter emerging from an egg. With Focus Noodles, each block of time results in cooking a ramen dish, which levels up your chef.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of these apps is especially helpful for those of us who gravitate toward picking up our phones for that much-needed dopamine. Both apps have ways of deterring users from using their phone during the focus session (the egg won’t hatch or the ramen won’t cook). It’s a fun way of keeping yourself from getting distracted as you work.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fcb90012;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>In short, this is for you if: </strong>You like gamified apps to keep you on task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>These apps appear to be free! Hooray!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. For developing new skills: Brain Hacks by Lara Honos-Webb</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This book is required reading for anyone with ADHD. Lara Honos-Webb, a clinician who really gets ADHD, has written a number of books on the subject — and <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/brain-hacks-life-changing-strategies-to-improve-executive-functioning-9781799755715/9781641521604?aid=3314&listref=mental-health-resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brain Hacks: Life-Changing Strategies to Improve Executive Functioning</a> is my favorite by far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book is organized by different challenges that ADHDers have, with strategies to tackle each of them. There’s also a quiz at the beginning of the book to see what areas you’re most in need of improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I really enjoy about Brain Hacks is that you can flip to any page in the book and find a useful strategy. It’s not a book you’ll ever need to read cover-to-cover (though you totally could!).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fcb90012;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>In short, this is for you if: </strong>You’re looking for practical strategies to improve your executive function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>This book is $13.79 on Bookshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I’m an affiliate! </strong>If you’d like to support the blog while supporting yourself, purchase the book <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/brain-hacks-life-changing-strategies-to-improve-executive-functioning-9781799755715/9781641521604?aid=3314&listref=mental-health-resources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. For better sleep: Sleep With Me Podcast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The stress of the pandemic absolutely killed my sleep schedule. Without <a href=\"http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/\">Sleep With Me Podcast</a>, I don’t know what I would do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sleep With Me is a unique podcast that’s hard to describe. It’s a friendly-but-boring voice, rambling in circles in a silly, entertaining (but not too entertaining!) way, to help ease you into sleep. While it didn’t work for me the first couple of tries, I stuck with it, and now I reliably fall asleep within a few minutes every night. It’s seriously like magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fcb90012;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>In short, this is for you if: </strong>You have trouble sleeping and need a little company in the deep, dark night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>It’s a free podcast available wherever you listen to podcasts.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. For paper-based planning: the Productivity Planner</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve included a lot of apps here, but for those of us who are a little more old fashioned, the best planner I’ve found by far is <a href=\"https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-productivity-planner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the Productivity Planner</a> by Intelligent Change.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11.54.30-am.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"15965\" data-permalink=\"http://letsqueerthingsup.com/2022/05/11/adhd-survival-guide-pandemic/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11-54-30-am/\" data-orig-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11.54.30-am.png\" data-orig-size=\"591,490\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11.54.30-am\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11.54.30-am.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11.54.30-am.png?w=591\" src=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11.54.30-am.png?w=591\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15965\" srcset=\"https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11.54.30-am.png 591w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11.54.30-am.png?w=150 150w, https://letsqueerthingsup.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/screen-shot-2022-05-11-at-11.54.30-am.png?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The planner helps you organize your weekly and daily goals, and uses a pomodoro tracker to help you focus in on each task. It increases time awareness, too, by having you estimate the amount of time a task will take and writing in the time it actually took. For ADHDers struggling with time awareness, this planner will literally train your brain into better estimations over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fcb90012;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>In short, this is for you if: </strong>You prefer analog solutions for planning your day, and need a little help structuring your tasks. OR, if you find yourself rotating between apps and planners, and want the additional option. This planner is dateless, so you can come back to it whenever without having to purchase a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>$30. Seriously worth every cent.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. For a tidier, less overwhelming home: Cleaning Sucks by Rachel Hoffman</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cleaning your home, especially after letting it go for a while, is <em>intimidating as eff</em>. Plain and simple. But <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/3314/9781250219725\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cleaning Sucks</a> by Rachel Hoffman makes it a little easier on our brains. This guided journal walks you through different projects in small, manageable chunks, and invites you to reflect on the process with space to write.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend this journal for anyone who is throwing their hands up with no idea where to begin. The gentle advice and straightforward prompts makes cleaning up feel like a doable project instead of an unruly disaster. It does require some commitment, but it’s a commitment that feels easier to make because of how approachable the journal is.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group has-background\" style=\"background-color:#fcb90012;\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>In short, this is for you if: </strong>You want to clean your space but have no idea where to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>$14.71 if you purchase via Bookshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I’m an affiliate! </strong>If you want to support the blog while supporting yourself, buy the book via <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/3314/9781250219725\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this link</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remember: Productivity isn’t about perfection.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Too often, talking about “productivity” becomes a smokescreen for masking our perfectionism. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to me, productivity doesn’t mean you meet every goal you set and complete every task on your to-do list! Rather, I think of productivity as a feeling of efficacy — feeling empowered while you work, knowing that you can shift your attention wherever it needs to be, at least for a little while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Forget what capitalism has told you about the hustle and grind. Productivity, from a neurodivergent perspective, is about having more agency, being able to focus <em>on our own terms</em>. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too often, our brains are in the driver’s seat, steering our attention in all sorts of directions (and almost never in the direction we’d like to go). Productivity, then, is about reclaiming our attention and being able to direct it as we choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many ADHDers are waiting for a magic bullet. I wish I could provide that, but alas, as I’ve said many times before, <strong><em>there isn’t one</em></strong>. Rather, there’s a big ol’ bucket of tools that we can pull from throughout our lives, mixing and matching as the circumstances require us to. This guide is one such bucket you can pull from to hopefully steer you back on track.</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Michael Jordan, arguably the greatest basketball player of all time got cut from his high school team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerburg both dropped out of Harvard, one of the best schools in the world, and would go on to be billionaires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin, famed author, inventor, diplomat and scientist would air bath. He would stand naked in front of an open window as he said the shock of cold water was too violent for him. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Too Specific to be useful </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So does that mean that in order to become an amazing basketball player you should get cut from your high school team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be a billionaire then you should drop out of university, especially Harvard?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To become a household name you should expose yourself to your neighbours every day instead of having a normal shower?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. Absolutely not. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this tells us is that when looking at successful people you have to ask yourself what happened to people that did the exact same thing but didn’t become successful. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nuance Counts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are numerous get rich quick gurus who say follow what I did and you will get the same results. Or they say they have studied some successful person and if you buy their book you too can be successful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is that the devil is in the details and nuance matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people around the world have been cut from their high school basketball team but there is only one Michael Jordan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that he got cut probably didn’t affect him at all, it is just a nice story, and people love a good narrative. What made him successful was a number of things, some you can replicate and some you can’t. It helps that he was 6’6″ (the same height as me, it also helped me with basketball), that he was one of the best athletes in the world, hyper-competitive (which he has called a curse), smart, hard-working, at the right moment when basketball was in a place where his skill sets could take advantage of the state of play. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard, so already they were not normal students or had normal lives. They both entered into an emerging technology environment. They both had access to that technology at home before they went to Harvard and were ahead of the curve in terms of skill. They both came from well off families so they weren’t risking everything by dropping out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benjamin Franklin doing air baths is just plain weird. I have nothing for that. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Context matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at someone that succeeds in doing x, then you need to look at all the people that did x and didn’t get the same results. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you in the same environment as the successful person? Do you have the same connections, privileges, or advantages? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you playing the same game or are you competing at a different game? Do you have the same natural talents as Michael Jordan or should you approach playing basketball another way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if someone fails doing x, that doesn’t mean it is a bad idea, look at all the people that did x and succeeded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many people that graduated from Harvard and have done alright for themselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many ways to be successful, and learning from others is a good shortcut to your advancement, but focusing on one thing about how they became successful without including all of the potential factors for success can lead you astray. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Context and nuance matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone succeeded did x, it doesn’t mean it was correct, are there people that did x and failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone does y and fails, it doesn’t mean that y isn’t right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is more to success than one variable.</p>\n",

My go-to activities when I need inspiration and motivation to tackle life and what it serves up are riding my bicycle, running, or enjoying a leisurely walk infused with rock tunes. It soothes the soul and quiets the mind, allowing me to focus and get on with that which matters. I love the poem by British-born American poet Edgar Albert Guest, ‘Keep Going’. Guest, known as the People’s Poet, paints everyday life, through his poetry, with inspiration and optimism. His poem ‘Keep Going’ does precisely that, when you want to give up or give in, Keep Going.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"6445\" data-permalink=\"http://realliferebel.com/2022/06/03/positive-vibes/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022/\" data-orig-file=\"https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png\" data-orig-size=\"2160,2160\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png?w=1024\" src=\"https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6445\" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png?w=620&h=620 620w, https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png?w=1240&h=1240 1240w, https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png?w=150&h=150 150w, https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png?w=300&h=300 300w, https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png?w=768&h=768 768w, https://lucullestols.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/positive-vibes_rlr_fb_post_1june2022.png?w=1024&h=1024 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Keep Going by Edgar Albert Guest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br>When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill,<br>When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br>And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,<br>When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>Rest if you must—but don’t you quit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is queer with its twists and turns,<br>As every one of us sometimes learns,<br>And many a failure turns about<br>When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br>Don’t give up, though the pace seems slow—<br>You may succeed with another blow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often the goal is nearer than<br>It seems to a faint and faltering man,<br>Often the struggler has given up<br>When he might have captured the victor’s cup,<br>And he learned too late, when the night slipped down,<br>How close he was to the golden crown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success is failure turned inside out—<br>The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br>And you never can tell how close you are,<br>It may be near when it seems afar;<br>So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit—<br>It’s when things seem worst that you mustn’t quit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img height=\"16\" width=\"16\" src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t35/2/16/2b50.png\" alt=\"⭐️\"> ‘If my mind can conceive it, if my heart can believe it, then I can achieve it.’ – Muhammad Ali <img height=\"16\" width=\"16\" src=\"https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t35/2/16/2b50.png\" alt=\"⭐️\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Positive Vibes!

        "content": "\n<p>I started journaling about 2 years ago. My friend Terri recommended The Legends Planner to me. At the time, I was away at academy for my new career. I was super stressed and I had all the time in the world to THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING.  I was sent down for 4 months during the middle of the pandemic so we were not allowed to leave the campus at all. Normally you were allowed to leave on weekends, as long as you were back for class 7:30am sharp. Being that at the time the vaccine wasn’t an option, we had no choice but to spend the 4 months locked up, literally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guys, it was exam after exam. I was not physically active before going down to the academy, I mean like consistently, so it was a bit of a challenge for me. I was required to complete a final fitness exam at the end. 24 push-ups or more in 1 minute, a sprint (can’t remember how far and how much time 😭), and to be able to run 1.5 miles in under 15 mins.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had to learn to balance my lifestyle, to not put too much focus on one thing so that I could equally deliver.  When I said I had so much time to think about everything, you could only guess it wasn’t all positive. Thoughts are things. They are powerful. They are preemptive. The very thoughts running through your mind can <strong>help to manifest the life of your dreams, or draw you closer to your greatest fears</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to put all my thoughts in my journal, the bad, and the good. I started to Jot down goals I had for myself so that I could look back and track my growth. I’d set a new goal for myself every week and I’d make sure to label the goal in my journal. It felt great to only be able to knock out a goal, but to be able to physically check it off a list as achieved. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to see something for yourself always gives you a better understanding, or a piece of mind. We get so caught up with different SHITuations  in life, different emotions, so distracted that we forget to give ourselves credit. Sometimes we don’t even realize how far we’ve come. I was beating myself up about something so minute, when I looked back at my journal, and saw all the goals I had set for myself the previous year, I was like wow. It made me super proud. This also gave me a boost to expand my mindset and give myself fresh new goals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Journaling also helps if you don’t like talking to people, you can put it all on paper. Journaling has been a blessing for me, and I thank my friend for introducing it to me. I’ll leave the link below to the journal I got on Amazon. Thank you so much for reading 🤎</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legend Planner Daily for 3 Months – Undated Deluxe Monthly Weekly & Daily Planner to Hit Your Goals & Live Happier.

As someone obsessed with self-help, it’s important to look at if self-care and self-motivation is actually helping. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always been someone who puts a lot of pressure on myself. Even from a young age, I was a perfectionist. If I couldn’t do a task to an incredibly high standard, then there was no point in doing it at all. This, as I have gotten older, I have realised is not helpful or healthy. At this point in my life, I don’t strive for every workout at the gym to be the best of my ability, or always improve every time I go. I focus on consistency. I am proud of myself for simply turning up (and trying my best). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure of results is something I have also removed in this area of my life, I don’t expect immense changes in my body straight away. I know with time, the results will come, as long as I keep at it and stop focusing only on the changes in my body. Truthfully, in other parts of my life, I am still working on this. Learning to enjoy the journey as much as the results, whatever they may be, is so important. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure of knowing what you want is another obstacle. I feel like trying to figure out who you are and what is you, takes time and takes you unlearning the need to be liked by everyone. This does take time. It takes a lot of investing in yourself and trusting in yourself. It isn’t something I believe comes overnight for anyone but it is so important for your happiness and growth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pressure we put on ourselves every day is sometimes needed, but when this pressure holds us back and makes us question ourselves, it can be debilitating. I am still on a journey to find the right balance for me but right now I choose to set myself free from any pressure so I can be the best me in the right now. </p>\n",

From major holidays to kickoff meetings to casual conversation, there is gold to be found everywhere. But too often the experience comes and goes without living up to the potential it promised. This is the deeper message behind the play <em>Our Town</em> and the movies <em>The Sixth Sense</em> and <em>Weekend at Bernie’s</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The best way to get the most out of any experience is to imagine it is already over before it has begun. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the meeting starts imagine you are walking out of it. Before you get in the car with another person imagine the drive is over. Before your guests arrive imagine they are leaving. Before you try that pick-up line imagine what the other person looks like when you are sober.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Then ask yourself these 3 questions:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What went right?</li><li>What went wrong?</li><li>What would I do better next time?</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>With this <strong>quick and easy pre-mortem evaluation</strong> you can ensure that you will:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Make the right things happen.</li><li>Fix what went wrong before it occurred.</li><li>Do things better THIS time.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I use the simple evaluation technique all the time. And I use it on massively different types of experiences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before Christmas or a birthday, I imagine the perfect day, map it out and schedule the day to live up to my expectations. More detail is better. So is more eggnog and more smiling. Smiling’s my favorite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also use this technique when I drive my kids to or from school. I think about the conversation I wish I had. I think about the opportunity to connect, encourage, or entertain as if it already slipped away. Then I make sure to connect, encourage or entertain while I still have a few minutes. And when the ride ends with my kids opening the door laughing I feel like we are winning at life. Especially if they remembered their backpacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Key Takeaway</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Understand your opportunities before they are gone. Imagine the final outcomes before they are baked. Then adjust anything you can to align your actual experience with your ideal. Great events don’t just happen. You make them happen. And a little forethought provides the road map you need to a better ending. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*If you know someone who could benefit from this message, please share it with them.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>+For more ways to create better outcomes, check out my new book <em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Does-Your-Fortune-Cookie/dp/B09NRDMKGR/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\" target=\"_blank\">What Does Your Fortune Cookie Say?</a></em> from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://ripples.media\" target=\"_blank\">Ripples Media. </a> </p>\n",

In my way of thinking absolutely!  While the concept of what is art is subjective there are commonalities we all have that make something art.  Merriam-Webster defines art as: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art\" target=\"_blank\">“the conscious use of skill and creative imagination, especially in the production of aesthetic objects”.</a>  Let me repeat that for the people in the back, “the conscious use of skill AND creative imagination, especially in the production of aesthetic objects”.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason this topic comes up again with me is that, once again, I saw a huge debate in a photography forum that started with the topic of sky replacements in Photoshop.  The person who started this conversation dislikes the sky replacement and said that essentially if you used such a thing you no longer had a photograph but “digital art”.  YAWN!  Here we go again.  This topic has been debated ad nauseam.  If you don’t like a tool don’t use it!  It is really that simple.  At the same time, don’t belittle the work of another.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I thought about while reading this dissensus was, that it must be great to be able to stay at a location or revisit it often enough and on a moment’s notice to get a photograph of said subject with a sky that perfectly matches your vision.  We’re not all on assignment from National Geographic that we get paid to sit and wait for weeks, or even months to be able to get that one particular moment in time.  Hells bells, for that matter I don’t even give care if it is total fantasy.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever walk around an art museum, you know the place with paintings, sculptures, and often photographs, you will probably find art that isn’t quite to your liking.  That is fine.  If every piece of a photograph I use is a photograph, then it is a photograph.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not creating snap-shot photography.  I work to create artful photographs.  If that means I have to use multiple tools, including sky replacement in Photoshop so be it.  Create your work your way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, by the way, just so that you know, I didn’t engage in this dissensus, aside from reading bit and pieces.  It isn’t worth my time.  I would rather be creating and debating a dead topic.  </p>\n",

As with the other places we visit (<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.baptistjax.com/locations/baptist-medical-center-beaches\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.flyjax.com/Home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, for instance), Roxie brings smiles and starts conversations with every person she meets. Every. One.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stand to the side and observe, happy to see the joy that a belly rub can bring. (That is, a belly rub for Roxie. The people are on their own when it comes to that. 😊) At the end of our rounds both of us have tired paws and renewed appreciation that comes with being allowed to serve our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our hospice visits have brought the same feelings along with a deeper introspection on my part. We meet patients (nearing the end of their life’s journey) as well as their families and friends. Once again, smiles and conversations occur—sometimes through tears. The patients often talk about dogs they had or <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.communityhospice.com/about/media-room/pet-peace-of-mind-finding-a-new-home-after-loss/\" target=\"_blank\">have</a>. Happy times. Joyful memories. Other times they speak about hobbies or sports teams. Again, fond remembrances. Love for what they have had and still have in their lives. They thank us for stopping by their rooms for what will probably be the last time we will see them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And each time I wonder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/gp5JCrSXkJY\"></a><strong>~~~~~</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Video Recommendation for the Week.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recorded in 2010, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/_GeJKoEHgts\" target=\"_blank\">“Love My Life”</a> reflects on looking back–and looking ahead. (The link: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/_GeJKoEHgts\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/_GeJKoEHgts</a>)  The late Rick “Hurricane” Johnson provided the keyboard for this track. We were fortunate to have his insights in the studio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/gp5JCrSXkJY\"></a><strong>~~~~~</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder what they might be thinking as they face the remaining precious moments of their lives. What do they see in their mind’s eye? What memories resonate? What do they see as their legacy? What did they not do that, if they had time, they would go after? What did they do that brings a smile to their soul? Would they do anything differently? What lessons did they learn and what advice would they proffer? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder, “What is the story their eyes are telling?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we need to wait until the end of the ride to evaluate the experience? In their way, those eyes that Roxie and I see tell us not to wait. Examine the doors, paths, and choices in front of us, and act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week I rediscovered a song I wrote for my <em>Find Your Happy Place!</em> CD. “Love My Life,” has a young man seeking counsel from an elder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>What do you regret?</em><br><em>If you could do it over</em><br><em>What would you forget?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The old man smiles, shakes his head, and reminds us that life is up to us.

Always be yourself and have faith in yourself. If You Can Believe It, You Can Achieve It · Belief is a practical instrument that you can use to shape reality. It empowers with mental energy and inspiration. Do not go out and look for a successful personality and try to duplicate it. Unleash your own treasure that is in you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3* Choosing to be grateful when you feel like complaining. Complaining only attracts negative thoughts and people. Gratitude, on the other hand, creates the opportunity for the best thinking and actions. Laugh, dance and Counting your blessings can be a great way to get out of a bad mood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4* Choosing to hang in there when you feel you’ve had enough. Feeling stuck or having enough is a story you tell yourself. The doctor can’t diagnose you with “feeling stuck.” That same doctor can’t take your temperature and send you off for tests and then come back and say “Well, the blood test says you’ve had enough. All of this is one giant story. You narrate your life through what you say to yourself in your head. Your thoughts are yours. E:G You can tell yourself a story of how you meet your first love and imagining how he or she become your life partner </p>\n\n\n\n<p>5* Knowing each new day is a true gift and fresh beginning. Every day is a chance to begin again. Don’t focus on the failures of yesterday, start today with positive thoughts and expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6* Valuing others, and treating others well. Treating others with respect and dignity is always encouraging. We are a prayer answer to each other. This builds up trust and safety and in turn, strong and positive relationships; Feel Good About Ourselves, When we treat people well </p>\n\n\n\n<p>7* Investing in people instead of chasing things. According to John C Maxwell, The first step toward success is becoming good at what you know how to do, but once you’ve mastered what you know, you begin to discover other. – God wants you to enjoy this life and Find out ways you can bless others and honor Him with them too. It’s important in life to invest in others. Without it your more like failure because when you are bless and your blessings are not blessings others, you are unimportant to God</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fly unlimited </p>\n",

This year I’ve been working on myself for myself and along this journey I have learned the following vital lessons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Stop comparing yourself to others:</strong> we often compare ourselves to others based on success, careers, lifestyles, bodies and social status. Start living your life for you – you have this life and no one else’s. This is your life, so live it for you and for you only.</li><li><strong>Fall forward:</strong> learn from every mistake you make. Mistakes are not something to be ashamed of – we’re human and we all make them. Treat them as an opportunity to do better at something and to strive for more.</li><li><strong>Be present</strong>: yesterday and tomorrow do not matter. What matters is today and how you are feeling right now. Got goals? How can you go about reaching them <em>today</em>, not tomorrow or next week?</li><li><strong>Say goodbye to those who don’t give positive energy</strong>: a painful process to do, but by deleting the people or accounts you follow online, this truly does set your mind into a new way of thinking. Only befriend those with pure, positive energy with whom you can be sure to be yourself and not think negatively about yourself.</li><li><strong>Alone time is vital in self-discovery</strong>: embrace loneliness. You are allowed to reinvent yourself within this journey. You don’t need to surround yourself with people 24/7. You need to spend time by yourself to truly begin to heal and to look after yourself.</li><li><strong>Gratitude really does change your mindset</strong>: since practising the art of being thankful for everything in my life every single day, it has changed my mindset into an “abundance mindset”. From there, you can start to look at life as a glass half-full, not half-empty.</li><li><strong>You are so much more than your body</strong>: abs do not define you and eating the lowest-cal item on the menu isn’t going to get you anywhere in life. This is something I have really struggled with, but now I am reaching the point where I can accept my body for what it is, as well as understanding that life is not about what foods you eat and how much exercise you do, but rather the memories you make, the friendships you create and the times you cherish with your loved ones. Your family and friends love you for who you are, not what you look like. Start to look within and be happy with the person you are from the inside out.</li><li><strong>You can achieve anything you want in life</strong>: the world really is your oyster. If you want something, what’s stopping you from getting it? If you manifest that dream and actively work towards it, it will all work out in the end.</li><li><strong>People pleasing is so last year</strong>: do things for you without worrying about what other people think. If you want to start that new hobby that your friends or family bully you for, do it anyway. Do it for yourself, nobody else.</li><li><strong>Burnout is serious; learn to take rest days</strong>: mentally and physically, burnout is the worst feeling. You feel frustrated that you can’t work and feel like a failure. Instead, tune your mind into the positive side – I can give my body and mind the rest it deserves.</li><li><strong>The only relationship that is yours forever is the one you have with yourself</strong>: treat yourself, body and mind, how you would your best friend or sister or mum. </li><li><strong>Your body is your friend</strong>: treat exercise as a celebration of what the body can do instead of a punishment. Rekindle that relationship with exercise and find new ways to enjoy it. Food, too, is something to enjoy! Food doesn’t define you – eat everything and all that you want. Just remember to have moderation and to move your body in some form most days the week. Restriction has no room in your life. Rules are SO last year. Enjoy the meals out and the endless takeouts and ice creams with your friends – that’s a life well-lived, not a life chained to the treadmill and low-cal options.</li><li><strong>Baby steps</strong>: good things take time; nothing happens overnight. Be patient with yourself and remember that everything will align in the end. Work towards your goals but in a sustainable way where you can enjoy the journey.</li><li><strong>Strive for progress not perfection</strong>: oftentimes we think the end goal must look like perfection – a perfect life, a perfect body, a perfect diet. Nothing in this world is perfect, and if it seems that way, it’s probably an illusion, a lie. Be proud of the progress you make each day mentally or within a fitness journey or goal. It’s great that we have high standards, but take a step back from perfectionism.</li><li><strong>Learn how to enjoy doing nothing</strong>: again, accept days off and extra long mornings in bed. We need time to recuperate and recover.</li><li><strong>Say yes to more opportunities</strong>: rip off the band aid and dive into the deep end. Get stuck into the world and enjoy the endless opportunities that life throws at you. Say yes to that date, to that trip away, to that deal you made with business. Just say yes.</li><li><strong>Friendships come and go</strong>: a difficult one, but it is something we have to learn. Not all of the friends we make in high school or even through our lives are going to stick with us until the end. Some are meant to be side stories of our lives until you go your separate ways. It’s hard to deal with losing a friend, on mutual grounds or not, but it’s even harder to deal with toxic friendships or carrying the weight of one that’s not going to last. Allow friendships to dissipate. Over our lifetime, friends come and go and change so fluidly. It’s normal.</li><li><strong>You aren’t supposed to be good at everything</strong>: not one person is a true all-rounder. You can’t be good at a sport you just started doing. Don’t compare yourselves to those people who have been doing it for longer than you. Don’t get frustrated if you honestly cannot do something, like play a musical instrument or draw (as some examples). We weren’t born to be all-rounders. That would be boring and life would be too easy if we were good at everything.</li><li><strong>Don’t take things seriously & have more fun</strong>: this is the last tip I have. Life isn’t supposed to be so serious all the time. Do spontaneous things and enjoy days and nights out with friends. <strong>Enjoy all the little moments and create a life for yourself that you once dreamed of having.</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div

        "content": "\n<p>Hai, Sahabat! Apa yang kamu pikirkan ketika mendengar kata Cinta Monyet? <em>By the way</em>, kita tidak sedang bicara soal cintanya seseorang kepada hewan (dalam hal ini adalah monyet), melainkan sebuah istilah hubungan antara lelaki dan perempuan dalam fase awal percintaan.<br /><br />Secara sederhana Cinta Monyet dapat diartikan sebagai bentuk cinta seseorang kepada lawan jenisnya untuk pertama kali dan ia tak tahu harus berbuat apa. Hal ini memberikan kesan betapa tingkahnya norak, konyol bahkan gila sebab ia kurang pengalaman dan belum tahu banyak hal tentang bagaimana cara mendekati si gebetan (orang yang ia taksir).<br /><br />Aku juga berpikir mengenai nama hewan yang disematkan di belakang kata ‘cinta’. Kenapa mesti monyet yang dipilih? Apakah si penemu istilah ini dulunya sering berkunjung ke kebun binatang atau hutan? Atau mungkin saat ia kasmaran, di rumahnya terdapat hewan peliharaan dari kelas primata. Apa kau tahu alasannya?<br /><br />Jika menelisik dari perilaku gerombolan monyet secara umum, tingkah laku mereka itu konyol, sering tertawa dan berteriak tanpa sebab, melakukan hal-hal gila demi sesuatu misal makanan. Mereka juga berpikiran pendek karena yang dipikirkan adalah bagaimana cara mengamankan pasokan makanan bahkan kalau perlu tega merebut dari monyet lain. Tentu tak semua monyet seperti itu. Karena ada pula monyet cerdas seperti Simpanse yang disebut-sebut peneliti memiliki kemiripan struktur otak 98% dengan manusia. <br /></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"14869\" data-permalink=\"https://ishfah7.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/cinta-monyet/cinta-monyet/\" data-orig-file=\"https://ishfah7.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cinta-monyet.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"350,332\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"cinta-monyet\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ishfah7.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cinta-monyet.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://ishfah7.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cinta-monyet.jpg?w=350\" src=\"https://ishfah7.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cinta-monyet.jpg?w=350\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14869\" srcset=\"https://ishfah7.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cinta-monyet.jpg 350w, https://ishfah7.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cinta-monyet.jpg?w=150 150w, https://ishfah7.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cinta-monyet.jpg?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Kembali ke soal di atas, sepertinya penyematan nama monyet dalam istilah Cinta Monyet lebih cenderung dipilih karena tingkah konyolnya. Waktu aku SD, di kelas 6 teman-teman siswi yang sekelas sudah mulai dewasa. Beberapa di antara mereka ada yang sudah mengalami siklus haid dan pertumbuhan buah dada yang signifikan. Dan secara naluri para bocah yang beranjak remaja ini ada yang sudah mengenal apa itu dandan. Mereka kreatif. Bisa belajar dari ibu, kakak atau sepupunya yang perempuan. Atau jika di era milenial seperti sekarang, sudah banyak <em>beauty vloger</em> dan MUA (<em>make up artist</em>) dadakan yang menebar ragam tips dan trik berdandan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saat para siswi sudah mulai dewasa dengan perubahan bentuk fisiologis tubuh dan psikologisnya, kami para siswa masih bertahan di posisi sama. Masih tolol dan tak tahu bagaimana cara memperlakukan perempuan. Yang kami tahu adalah menjaili mereka, iseng, kadang-kadang sampai merundungnya tapi kami senang. Tertawa-tawa dan bahagia melihat teman siswi sekelas diperlakukan seperti itu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tentu ada saja siswi yang berani dan balas melawan kelakuan para siswa. Seperti jika ada siswi yang dijaili dengan menaruh sisa permen karet di kursinya sehingga ketika diduduki dan bangkit si permen karet itu akan melekat erat pada rok merahnya. Dan bagi kalangan siswi yang pemberani, akal jail terlintas pula di pikirannya. Ia akan mengambil penghapus papan tulis kapur (waktu aku kecil belum ada papan tulis putih dan spidol) lalu menempelkannya di pipi siswa jail tadi. Ah, tidak berhenti hingga di sana. Rambut hitamnya pun tak luput menjadi sasaran empuk. <em>Plus </em>celana pendek warna merah menjadi target berikutnya. Dan suasana kelas menjadi riuh-rendah, berantakan, tidak karuan. Yang kami lakukan berikutnya adalah tertawa sebelum datang guru, lengkap dengan omelan dan mistar kayu panjang yang diacung-acungkan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pun demikian, benih-benih cinta bisa dirasakan pada anak-anak semi remaja ini. Cinta monyet itu datang juga kepadaku. Di kelas 6, tak akan pernah aku lupa, ada siswi yang aku sukai. Alasannya cukup konyol karena nama dia sama-sama berawal huruf F. Selain itu orangnya kalem dan lembut. Kalau dia senyum luluhlah semua pertahananku. Kalau berpapasan dengannya aku selalu degdegan. Jauh lebih berdebar dibandingkan biasanya. Seolah-olah ada tukang pemukul bedug yang tinggal di jantungku. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Namun semakin aku mengenal dan mengikuti semua informasi darinya, aku patah hati untuk pertama kali. Bukan karena cinta ditolak sebab aku belum sempat menyatakannya, melainkan sebuah tradisi di kampung halamanku. Jika ada orang tua yang memiliki anak gadis, lalu ada lelaki yang berkeinginan untuk meminangnya, ditambah si lelaki merupakan bagian dari keluarga terpandang di kampung, maka sudah bisa dipastikan anak gadis itu akan dijodohkan. Dan itu yang terjadi kepadanya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bagi beberapa orang tua di kampungku, terutama mereka yang masuk dalam kalangan ekonomi lemah dan memiliki anak gadis maka semakin cepat dipinang orang semakin baik. Perjodohan macam ini lumrah terjadi di era aku masih kecil (entah sekarang apakah sudah berubah). Bahkan saat aku lulus SMA, hanya 3 orang (termasuk aku) dari teman sekelas lulusan SD yang belum menikah. Ada teman-temanku yang menikah/dinikahkan usai lulus SD, SMP, atau SMA. Beragam. Tergantung syarat dan kondisinya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Memang tak semua menikah lantaran dijodohkan, ada juga yang jatuh cinta kepada lawan jenis yang berusia di atasnya. Jika teman-temanku semasa SD menikah itu sebelum umur mereka 18 tahun maka aku menikah di usia 28. Menikah bukan soal siapa yang cepat menuju ke pelaminan tetapi tentang keberkahan setelah acara resepsi. Kehidupan seseorang baru akan masuk ke babak baru setelah menikah. Dikatakan bahwa orang yang menikah itu menyempurnakan agamanya. Karena dari lahir hingga saat memikah, ia sudah menjalani sebagian kehidupannya. Sebagian lagi ia jalani usai melangsungkan resepsi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tentang Cinta Monyet yang kita bahas di atas, ada satu pertanyaan yang naik ke permukaan. Bisakah Cinta Monyet itu serius?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Berkaca dari pengamatan dan pengalaman dari masa kecil hingga sekarang, Cinta Monyet bisa serius jika terdapat hal-hal berikut:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Kecocokan mental, yaitu kondisi ketika seseorang bisa menjadi dirinya sendiri di depan orang (si pasangan). Sudah tidak merasa malu untuk melakukan apa saja.</li><li>Perilaku yang mirip (pada pasangan) dengan orang yang ia kagumi. Misal ia (perempuan) mengagumi lelaki yang baik hati dan santun seperti bapaknya. Atau ia (lelaki) menyukai perempuan yang sangat perhatian layaknya sang ibu.</li><li>Tingkat kenyamanan (<em>level of comfort</em>) yaitu keadaan ketika sesorang merasa nyaman dekat pasangan.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Seseorang yang sudah kenal cukup lama (karena cinta monyet saat remaja) memiliki potensi untuk menjadi cinta yang serius (berujung ke pernikahan) jika mereka memiliki ketiga hal di atas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apakah kamu pernah mengalami Cinta Monyet?

I have learnt that I should always seek wise counsel from those ahead. Instead of doing trial and error, always begin with intention. Plan ahead the ending and the overall outcome. Here are 5 lessons that I am currently learning in my 20s.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><video controls src=\"https://theessentiallocal.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/youcut_20220508_145833130.mp4\"></video></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>Learn from these lessons and begin to live a more peaceful and abundant life.</strong> </p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"has-primary-color has-text-color\"><li>Never give from an empty cup:                      Supporting and living are always interconnected. We must be able to receive the value, wisdom, support, and community to help us live. We then are able to share with others our wonderful experiences.</li><li>Learn to speak life:                                  What does that mean exactly? Well the simple truth is that our words and what we say are powerful. We can either build ourselves, or others up, or tear each other down. That is why it is important to speak words of life every time we start the day, or before we enter into it. What do you want to see or experience, speak those words and it will become a reality.</li><li>The glass is half full not half empty:          In this journey we often find ourselves comparing to one another. Looking inwardly and believing that we are a work in progress. The truth is that we already have contents inside of us. Such value that exist means we are not being emptied, but rather there is more in filling. That is how we can grow when we see the potential we already posses.</li><li>Being content where you are:                     It is easy to feel not good enough, to keep desiring more. Yet, the more you acquire, does not equate to happiness. We need to be able to appreciate how far we have come. Whatever takes time is always of  higher value.</li><li>Learn to let go:                                               As simple as this may sound, it is a lesson that I’m currently learning. Letting go is not a quick fix to the pain. But a breath of fresh air and relief. When we realise that, the past hurts and people don’t have to exist in our present thoughts and feelings. We are capable of allowing the new to come into our life. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"embed-instagram\"><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc7azNsLtz3/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

        "content": "\n<p>There are times and events that can drive us to lament or celebrate our journeys in life. Sometimes there are no shortages of either. Sometimes the balance is in one direction or the other. It is the blessing and the curse of the human condition that we are destined to live by these happenings in our lives and the lives of our loved ones. It is very often that the hard times feel like they go on forever, and the sweetness in life gets diluted by the things that can drive us down. There is no handbook on how we deal with these things, and there is no shortage of explanations, reasoning, and advice on the expectations of how we should deal with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the ongoing events in the world today, which I will leave you to pick from, which has no lack of a historical back catalogue to choose from, and it makes you wonder how anyone at any time ever is in control of how happy they are. Were we ever? I recently watched a documentary about the loss suffered by some families that were heart-breaking in its telling and more so in realising the realities they now live with. Some after a passage of time, and some more immediate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of a series of stories I came across that, in all cases, were human-made situations, with human-made suffering tailored in many instances by human perpetrators. Yet, the level of kindness observed by others when people are struggling or in need is an equally powerful human gesture and an expression that we can be better. This expression of kindness is often translated into action after an unfortunate event, but does it need to be always that way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kindness never seems to translate very well on a global scale, and more often than not, it is an intensely personal thing leveraging our own life experiences to sustain it. These days, people call out others’ “fake” kindnesses. I wonder how kind they are in their lives? I have found that whether it is with my family, my friends or at work when I put kindness at the forefront of my every action, it is then that my space, my world becomes a more positive liveable space to be in. I would go as far as to say that I try to practice kindness, as I do not always succeed. It would be naive to think that everyone being kind would solve every problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Kindness begins with the understanding that we all struggle” Charles Glassman</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I challenge you to take the edge off of someone’s struggle. Bring down a barrier or two and express a part of yourself that may or not be regularly brought to the fore, or maybe it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be courageous. Be kind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please share your views on experiences related to kindness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewpenrose/\">Andrew Penrose</a> for the guest post. If you are interested in providing a guest post please do not hesitate to contact me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Think Katherine Mansfield, Janet Frame, Sam Neill, Jane Campion, The Piano, Once Were Warriors, The Lord of the Rings trilogy… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll say straight off the bat that this post is a shameless plug for a writing project in which I have a tiny stake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Backyard Earth</em> is the brainchild of a Kiwi indie publisher, <a href=\"https://www.patchworkraven.com/about\">The Patchwork Raven</a>, a garage band publisher with a ‘penchant for perfectionism, and a love of gorgeous words presented in beautiful packaging…challenging some of the assumptions about how that happens, but not at the cost of quality.’ Have I got your attention yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My writers’ group first alerted me to this opportunity a couple of years ago. In short, the project aims to publish five books, one for each of the five continents – Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia and Oceania – and containing a story for every country on each of those continents. Crazily ambitious? Yes. But wouldn’t it be amazing to be a part of something this wildly out of left field?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is being sought is writing that evokes a sense of the actual place, something that feels local. While it helps to live or have lived in the country being written about, this is not essential to having your work accepted. Stories can be up to 5,000 words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of a couple of months ago, Africa was 26% filled, the Americas 34%, Asia 41%, Europe 60% and Oceania 20%. Submissions will be accepted for as long as it takes to fill the quota for each continent. There are more than 100 countries for which stories have yet to be accepted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further information, including tips on what’s likely to work or not, document formatting, payment, contact details and so on are <a href=\"https://www.patchworkraven.com/backyardearth\">here</a>. So what are you waiting for? Start writing! Be a part of an unusual and exciting project!</p>\n",

The example of clear understanding is there in the <em>Bhagavad-gita </em>itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the <em>Gita </em>directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand <em>Bhagavad-gita </em>in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the <em>Bhagavad-gita </em>all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the <em>Gita</em>. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna.<a href=\"https://asitis.com/1/1.html#190\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The topics discussed by Dhrtarastra and Sanjaya, as described in the <em>Mahabharata, </em>form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind.<a href=\"https://asitis.com/1/1.html#191\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The word <em>dharma-ksetra </em>(a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dhrtarastra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons’ ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sanjaya, “What did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?” He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother Pandu were assembled in that Field of Kuruksetra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruksetra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the <em>Vedas </em>as a place of worship—even for the denizens of heaven—Dhrtarastra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of Pandu favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sanjaya was a student of Vyasa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vyasa, Sanjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruksetra even while he was in the room of Dhrtarastra. And so, Dhrtarastra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.<a href=\"https://asitis.com/1/1.html#192\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the Pandavas and the sons of Dhrtarastra belong to the same family, but Dhrtarastra’s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of Pandu from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dhrtarastra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of Pandu. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruksetra where the father of religion, Sri Krsna, was present, the unwanted plants like Dhrtarastra’s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhisthira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words <em>dharma-ksetre </em>and <em>kuru-ksetre, </em>apart from their historical and Vedic importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reference : Bhagavad Gita As It is – Swami Prabhupada </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contribute to the blog: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/spiritualGS?v=1&utm_source=unp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=RT000481&utm_unptid=2fed7ed8-e4ae-11ec-b5f2-3cecef6afc84&ppid=RT000481&cnac=IN&rsta=en_GB%28en-IN%29&cust=CV6EA45ZUFULS&unptid=2fed7ed8-e4ae-11ec-b5f2-3cecef6afc84&calc=f102309ae55eb&unp_tpcid=ppme-social-business-profile-created&page=main%3Aemail%3ART000481&pgrp=main%3Aemail&e=cl&mchn=em&s=ci&mail=sys&appVersion=1.92.0&xt=104038\" target=\"_blank\">PayPal.Me/spiritualGS</a></p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Every day, billions of people wake up in the morning and go about their busy days. For some, the busyness of the day does not allow for time to reflect, while for others, the mundane routine offers little to look forward to, or to be grateful for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nature of life today does not often lend itself to recognizing the miracles happening around us and often to us. It is this inability to see everyday miracles in our lives that often causes depression, anxiety and hopelessness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we focus more on the miracles in our lives, we can have a better outlook on life and be happier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few everyday miracles that we may be overlooking</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>People changing before your eyes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve heard it before, the saying that “people don’t really change.” Well, that couldn’t be farther from the truth. We’ve all seen the examples. What about abusive, alcoholic father who somehow, someway came to his senses to overcome addiction, save his marriage and family relationships?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.</p><cite>Leo Tolstoy</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Myriad other examples flood the earth everyday. When you accept that people can and do change, you see miracles in abundance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Another of the little miracles is the gift of our senses. What we can hear, see and smell. “When in doubt, play Mozart, eat chocolate” is one of my imagined bumper stickers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you tried to look at the world through the eyes of children? They show us how to reappreciate the miracles of our senses. There are plenty of videos online of children amazed by the small things around them, playing with their dog, transfixed by a butterfly dancing and so much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a miracle that the sun rises every day. It is a miracle that we rise up too, every day. It is a miracle that we can breathe. It is a miracle that the body intuitively knows what to breathe. It is a miracle that our heart is pumping without being commanded to do so. It is a miracle we can see. It is a miracle we can hear. It is a miracle we can eat and speak using the same mouth. It is a miracle that we can touch and feel and walk and lift. It is a miracle that we know what something as abstract as emotion is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a day when the sun forgets to rise or the earth stops to rotate. Imagine a day when you don’t rise up. Or a day when you cannot breathe. Or your heart stops to pump. Or your eyes stop to see. Or your ears stop to hear. Or your mouth cannot eat or your speech is lost. Or you cannot touch nor feel nor walk nor lift. Or you stop to feel any emotion what-so-ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to acknowledge and express gratitude for all of these miracles everyday if we want our lives to be full of miracles, big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a lovely song by Luther Vandross from Never Let Me Go – the album would go on to be nominated for multiple Grammy Awards and be awarded Platinum status.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_s6URZeAps?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en&autohide=2&wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I would love to do is talk to someone, wish I knew who<br>Sometimes the people who know the least say the most<br>Makes you wonder who you can trust, what’s gonna happen<br>First thing I know, God is love<br>The next thing would be, He loves me<br>Sometimes I’m tired of waiting for a thing or someone<br>Then I stop and see what He’s done and I know everything will come</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe today, anything can change, nothing stays the same<br>Maybe today, what’s tomorrow for, no one knows for sure<br>Through it all, come what mayLittle miracles happen everyday</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there you go, strangely enough<br>Alone even though, addicted to love<br>You’re in and out so quickly that it gives you a start<br>You’re waiting for a message or a word but you haven’t heard from your heart</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe today, things can change, nothing stays the same<br>Maybe today, is for the love we need, I really believe<br>Through it all, come what may<br>Little miracles happen everyday</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is a miracle?<br>Love is a miracle<br>Every time that you care, a miracle, it happens somewhere<br>So many miracles, even small little miracles<br>Just take one look about, it’s not hard to figure out</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Cause it might be today, anything can change nothing stays the same<br>And maybe today, what’s tomorrow for, no one know for sure<br>Through it all, come what may<br>Little miracles happen everyday<br>Little miracles happen ev’ry day<br>Little miracles happen everyday<br>They happen everyday</p>\n",

Poems are usually structured in lines rather than in paragraphs. They consist of image, sound, and rhythm. Poems uncover truths and are spontaneous outpourings of powerful feelings. It is important for the reader to relate to the poet’s words. Read the poem once silently, then once out loud, in order to get a better understanding of the poet’s intentions. What is the first impression? A poem usually has plural meanings. Arming yourself with a dictionary is good advice. What tone or mood does the poem have?</p>\n",

What’s hard for you, might not be hard for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe people try something, whether it be running, weight lifting, painting, writing, ect. They do it and think to themselves, “man this is harder than i thought.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, that individual sees someone else who has been doing that same workout or job for a lot longer, and they think to themselves, “it’s easier for them.” “They make that look easy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well of course it’s easier for some people than others! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People have more experience. They could be naturally gifted at what you feel is hard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bet if you take a look at yourself, there are things you do with relative ease that other think is “hard.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had this experience myself the first time I did yoga. Man was I humbled that day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time a 26 year old weight lifter. I was strong and in fairly good shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going into yoga that day I was expecting to be able to perform not perfectly but with no real issues. It was me an about 10 other individuals. Most over the age of 55..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the class progressed I quickly was realizing how difficult yoga could be. Holding the awkward positions, along with the 90 degree heat, and the deep muscle stretches, I was in a world of hurt. Quitting actually crossed my mind. I would never.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paying attention to the others around me I noticed elderly women, flowing through the practice with control and poise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you take those same elderly women and bring them into a gym to have them bench press or squat heavy weight, that may seem more difficult to them. To me that is not as hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, hard is hard. Don’t worry if someone else makes it look easy, because if it’s hard for you, then it’s hard. It’s just the way it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to make it easier, is with consistency, grit, work, an a unshakable mindset to get better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>#nolimits #shatteringlimitsfitness</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Reading this article could bore you out of your skull – or maybe not. In the #ProChoice world we are living in, you are obviously free to choose to click away and read other things, or to read this one to the end, and make up your own mind if what I have to say would add some value to your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if this was a complete waste of your time, I invite you to vent your #FreedomOfExpression in the comment box below. If it is not obvious by now, I’m about to expand on a social justice topic, or rather, a theory thereof. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What are Critical Theories?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All Critical Theories look at a certain topic or theme through the lens of society and culture. Inevitably, the largest problems facing society get so distorted that the collective consciousness focuses heavily on these so-called social or political justice issues. It seems that almost everything becomes a social justice cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Karl Marx defined it in his letter to Arnold Rugage written in 1843 Critical Theory is<br>“the self-clarification (critical philosophy) of the struggles and wishes of the age”<br>And while this philosophy seems terribly philosophical current practical examples, of the different Critical Theories, are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A current social manifestation of Critical Race Theory is – #BlackLivesMatter</li><li>A current social manifestation of Critical Gender Theory is – #LGBT</li><li>A current social manifestation of Critical Pleasure Theory is #ProChoice</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, all these hot debates. While all of these deserve an in-depth look on their own, I want to focus on: </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Critical Blame Theory</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We have all met that person who has the mentality that somebody owes me. They attribute all problems to somebody else. It’s the government’s fault…, it’s my parent’s fault… Everything that is going wrong in my life is anybody else’s fault, just not mine. Their entire worldview is set to blame someone for everything. It’s the someone should do it for me, so-called victim mentality.<br>According to <a href=\"https://moodle.christianleadersinstitute.org/admincli/application/?source=studentsarinasteinlein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Henry Reyenga and Steve Elzinga in their mini-course called Critical Grace Theory</a>, this blame mindset stems from the following problem:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“If there is no God and no morality based on something higher than ourselves, then all there is left is …<br>… ME”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I often wonder when will men stop blaming women for all their problems. It seems like something which has been going on since the fall.<br>It’s much easier blaming someone else. We can see this clearly in Genisis Chapter 3. Eve points the finger at the snake. Adam points the finger at Eve, and then ultimately at God.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why God, why?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Someone has got to take the blame.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But equally horrible, when we can’t put the blame on anybody else but ourselves. You end up in a never-ending mental spiral:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I’d only …<br>If I’d only not …<br>I should have known better…<br>Why did I have to …<br>I knew it was wrong at the time, but still, I chose to …</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blame. Fault. Guilt. Sin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Laying on the cold hard floor, wet with your own tears in remorse.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We live in a culture which will always point a finger. Blame is so intrinsically set in our DNA, we just can’t help otherwise. We scream for justice at the most minor injustice. Sorry I’m not so sorry. Most times, people just don’t care that their behaviour has hurt or upset someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, this is the problem which Grace resolves. By His Grace, that is God’s Gift to us, which when you look at God’s righteousness none of us deserves, but still our loving God, died for our sin. He took all the blame and nailed it to the cross.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Whisper, whisper in my ear …</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single, if I’d only<br>Every single, if I’d only not<br>Every single, I should have known better<br>Every single, Why did I have to …<br>Every single I knew it was wrong but still I chose to …</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single why, God why which never belonged to God. And<br>Every sorry, I’m not so sorry, something someone has done to you for which he just can’t seem to care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Whisper, whisper in my ears …</em></strong><br>As I’m lying in my tears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single: Blame. Fault. Guilt.<br>Drenched in the blood of Christ who paid the price, the penalty.<br>Jesus took the blame. Justice was served upon the cross.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Whisper, whisper in my ears …</em></strong><br>Write on a piece of paper that which causes you these tears.<br>Cross it out, because at the cross, Jesus paid the price for it.<br><strong>Every single, every single, no longer belongs to you.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I can take hold of Jesus’ promise that he will always be with me. There is nothing in all creation which will separate me from the love of Jesus, which was so graciously was shed for me upon the cross. (Romans 8)</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>“He made the one who did not know sin to be sin on our behalf, in order that we could become the righteousness of God in him.”</p><cite>2Corinthians 5:21 (LEB)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>“Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.”</p><cite>Hebrews 9:22 (LEB)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Become kind toward one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as also God in Christ has forgiven you.</p><cite>Ephesians 4:32 (LEB)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">***</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, with God’s gift of grace, I can face my own failures and take responsibility. Because of His Grace, I can let go of the blame I have towards others and offer myself the freeing gift of their forgiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Whisper, whisper in my ear …</strong><br>You are my child. I will always be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eD_xQNhBlfM?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en&autohide=2&wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n",

However, the greatest source of power is the power of God, and when you tap into this infinite reservoir of power, we refer to it as, <em>“spiritual power.”</em> God gave you a spirit and the power to achieve everything you want and need in life if what you want is consistent with what God wants for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Spiritual power is the part of your spirit that governs your capacity for achievement. In life, we’re constantly trying to accomplish a goal, to overcome a challenge, to bring something into fruition. The power part of your spirit determines when, where, how and with whom you will achieve or not achieve that thing you want. Although power resides within your spirit, you need the wisdom of God to wield it. You’ve come to earth to gain the wisdom and experience to put the pieces of your life together, and you need spiritual power to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">If you had more spiritual power, what would you do with it? Managed properly, you would heal yourself and heal others, pay bills, increase your wealth, get a better job or become self-employed, be a better parent, a better spouse, improve relationships, help others to grow and develop, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The goal of life is to become a divine being. The more you function in the world as a divine being, the greater your spiritual power. The problem is we’re constantly chasing the things we want and need in life in the wrong way – we’re relying solely on our physical resources which are always limited and unreliable. But if the greatest source of power comes from God, we should seek spiritual power and all other things will emanate from that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Let’s say, for example, you need a job. Of course, you’ll need to search for a job, network, and all those other tasks required to gain employment. But more importantly, you must focus on improving your character which will increase your spiritual power. Ultimately, you just don’t want another job – you want the power to never be without a steady source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

However, most of us don’t dedicate our lives to mastering this path. The path to divinity is cultivating peace through the challenges of poverty or illness or injustice, or temptation or whatever. You’ll usually find your major challenges in your family, career, finances, and health. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>God didn’t make a mistake when God created you. God established a curriculum for your life which defines the purpose for your existence in this lifetime. You can achieve your destiny because God wouldn’t bring you into this world for you to be destined to fail. In fact, there would be no purpose for God to bring you into the world and not give you the ability to overcome your challenges in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, you think you have a better way than God. And your way is a human approach which will inevitably lead to failure because it creates disorder. What you want in life often isn’t in harmony with the divine plan. Remember – your life is planned. It’s your job to construct a good life for yourself and your family, and to do that, you need to follow God’s blueprint. Whenever we attempt to veer off the path that God laid for us, we run into “delays”, obstructions, denials, etc. God breaks things up because whatever you were trying to do wasn’t in your destiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since your life is planned, you can prepare for the inevitable challenges you will face. Your biggest challenges usually come in the form of other people. God puts people in your life to help you to grow. God puts that cheating husband or that alcoholic wife or that hardheaded child in your life for your benefit. You can’t avoid people. Stop blaming other people for your problems. Instead, learn to appreciate the people in your life. More importantly, you must appreciate God for giving you the opportunity to grow spiritually through your interaction with others.  </p>\n",

In Bantu philosophy, for example, they place man in the same category as God – Muntu. This means we have a duty to purge all thoughts and behaviors that do not reflect our divinity. We are patient and kind to others because everyone, whether they know it nor not, is seeking to achieve the same goal in life and we will make mistakes along the way. We make mistakes because man is the only creature that shares with God the freedom to choose. During your time on earth, you must choose to become a divine being and establish proof of God’s existence. </p>\n",

I’ve read ample books with bitter, immature adults wreaking havoc on everything, but this has to be the worst of all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How is it that not a single character could redeem the story? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>narrative follows different timelines and POVs</strong>. Some chapters show us what’s happening in the present as they make their way to the island. The others chronicle events in the lives of the 6 primary characters and who they were at some point in their lives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also switches from first-person to third-person narrative, and that made for an interesting change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This back and forth makes sense because you get to understand the characters more (they’re still horrible, though!), and there’s a <strong>crucial element that is tied together at the end</strong>, which was quite predictable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <strong>liked whatever the author has included of the island and its descriptions</strong>. But all of that gets overshadowed by the presence and actions of these characters. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, don’t get me wrong. I do enjoy reading books even if <strong>the characters are morally grey</strong> as long as their storylines are either convincing or engaging for whatever reason. Here, you can’t help but detest them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nico is an asshole. He doesn’t take Lux seriously, is often gaslighting her and does exactly what you’d expect him to do. It becomes evident that the only reason Lux is with him is that she has been coping with grief and finds solace in the distraction. Understandable. Still, their <strong>relationship is astonishingly unhealthy</strong>. In fact, there’s not a single friendship or companionship that is borne out of anything genuine or honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other characters too have skeletons in their closet, which you eventually get to know about. It’s all pretty messed-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the <strong>core themes of the book are murder, cheating, and deception</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I liked reading Rachel Hawkins’ <em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://thelifestories2.wordpress.com/2021/01/07/the-wife-upstairs-by-rachel-hawkins/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wife Upstairs</a></em> much better than <em>Reckless Girls</em>. If you haven’t yet picked this one up, I <strong>wouldn’t recommend it</strong>.</p>\n",

There’s so much to learn from their journeys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, I’m still just as fond of books with a scavenger hunt. This one executes that element pretty well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To think that <strong>one-third of the way in, I was actually getting a little disappointed</strong>, and I thought this would be an average read because I wasn’t a fan of the whole “popular girl runs away” trope. It reminded me too much of John Green’s <em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://thelifestories2.wordpress.com/2016/05/27/book-review-paper-towns-by-john-green/\" target=\"_blank\">Paper Towns</a></em> and Sara Barnard’s <em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://thelifestories2.wordpress.com/2018/03/11/book-review-goodbye-perfect-by-sara-barnard/\" target=\"_blank\">Goodbye, Perfect</a></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are books I liked a great deal when I read them several years ago. But I don’t particularly care for such plot points now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, I <strong>didn’t really like Chloe’s character all that much</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after having been super impressed by McQuiston’s <em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://thelifestories2.wordpress.com/2021/06/26/one-last-stop-by-casey-mcquiston/\" target=\"_blank\">One Last Stop</a></em>, I should’ve known <strong>the author is beyond talented in her ability to create heartfelt, meaningful stories</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What started out as three students, who in an alternate universe would probably not have been friends, chasing clues to find Shara quickly <strong>turns into this jubilant acceptance and celebration of the self</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of it took me back to my high school days and the things that mattered to us then. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the beauty of Casey McQuiston’s stories. They are relatable, inspiring, and just bursting with life. Her <strong>writing style in this novel is full of a flair for the dramatic and humorous</strong>. I found myself chuckling along quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Mr Truman would’ve made for a great literature teacher. And that speech at the end by Chloe? WONDERFUL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, there are a couple of aspects of the book I didn’t particularly like. But there’s so much more that I loved! <strong>Highly highly recommend</strong> this if you enjoy reading YA contemporary books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Note: I received an ALC of this book from Libro.fm in exchange for an honest review.</em></p>\n",

Now, he keeps her hidden away from the rest of Caverna, fearful of what may come to pass should the Court and their enemies find the <strong>truth behind Neverfell’s presence in the underground city</strong>. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>His worst nightmares come to pass when the twelve-year-old’s thirst for the outside world brings her to a dangerous path.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frances Hardinge’s writing feels like a gift</strong> – you’re almost hesitant to unwrap it, but once you get a peek, you’re in a mad rush to see it all. At least, that’s how I felt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She writes in the most spellbinding manner! Just the right bit of focus on worldbuilding, just the right bit of focus on action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her <strong>writing style is straightforward and vivid</strong>. You are immediately transported to the scene that you’re reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first few chapters, I was a bit baffled trying to grasp the various elements of this world she has created. But once I understood what all of the terms meant, the reading was smooth sailing from there on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Almost 500 pages long</strong>, the story is certainly eventful. There are <strong>numerous conflicts introduced</strong> which make you anxious for Neverfell’s well-being, and <strong>her character goes through quite the life-altering journey</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/a-face-like-glass-book-review.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"3693\" data-permalink=\"http://thelifestories.blog/2022/07/13/a-face-like-glass-book-review/a-face-like-glass-book-review/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/a-face-like-glass-book-review.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"2196,2199\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.7","credit":"","camera":"SM-G935F","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1658006720","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.2","iso":"200","shutter_speed":"0.058823529411765","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"a-face-like-glass-book-review\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/a-face-like-glass-book-review.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/a-face-like-glass-book-review.jpeg?w=1024\" src=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/a-face-like-glass-book-review.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3693\" width=\"368\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/a-face-like-glass-book-review.jpeg?w=368 368w, https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/a-face-like-glass-book-review.jpeg?w=736 736w, https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/a-face-like-glass-book-review.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/a-face-like-glass-book-review.jpeg?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Copyright © 2022 Meera Nair</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This being <strong>a middle-grade/ YA fantasy</strong> didn’t deter me from thoroughly enjoying it. There’s so much hope and energy at the heart of it that you can’t help but be swept up in the tides of this mesmerizing tale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I loved Neverfell’s character. She is curious, brave, and loyal. She is almost naïve to the point of being taken advantage of. But that is also perhaps her strongest trait – being an empath and being a fighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <strong>many characters in the novel</strong>, many of whom will leave an impression on you. The Kleptomancer and Erstwhile were a couple of my other favourite characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of you may wonder what’s the point of a world divided by the people’s ability to express themselves through facial expressions. I found greater meaning in it. The author <strong>uses hierarchies to mirror our world today</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also brings in the notion of how the more affluent families have greater freedom of speech than those who are in the lower echelons of society. This couldn’t be more true for us too! Human rights aren’t accorded the same importance in implementation as they are on paper, isn’t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entirety of this novel is not just about social causes, appreciating our surroundings, and setting wrongs right. It has a wonderfully magical ambience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <strong>Caverna being an underground world</strong> where:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Facesmiths train people to don certain expressions</li><li>Wines alter memory</li><li>Perfumes make people susceptible to influence</li><li>Spices sharpen senses</li><li>And cheeses bring visions</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The worldbuilding is intricate and brimming with potential. And Hardinge ha<strong>s executed all of this with such aplomb</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some chapters towards the end where I felt that <strong>1-2 scenes dragged for a bit longer than necessary</strong>. But I was so excited to get to the end of Neverfell’s adventure that it didn’t bother me too much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last section of the book where a plan comes into play is brilliantly crafted!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To end this long book review, I have one important question – WHEN IS A FACE LIKE GLASS BEING MADE INTO A DISNEY MOVIE? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3yRQNR0\" target=\"_blank\">A Face Like Glass</a></em> is a must-read</strong> if you enjoy <strong>layered fantasy novels with a sprightly main character</strong>.</p>\n",

When two girls go missing in the span of days, each with an obscure connection to Chloe, she is determined to act before it’s too late.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like it when stories are narrated through alternating chapters – either from different character perspectives or of varying timelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, the <strong>chapters are made of two timelines – the past and the present</strong> – adding to our understanding of how Chloe feels about her father’s arrest and the guilt she suffers from for believing that she is somehow responsible for the deaths of some of those girls. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, there were several statements that she would make, which I began to read into, and I was certain who the new serial killer must be. These statements seemed too “by chance” to be just meaningless utterances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I was wrong! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of late, I’ve been reading quite a few murder mysteries where there’s sufficient evidence or motivation linking one character to the crime. But the <strong>revelation just upends everything you’ve come to understand about the primary characters</strong> and somehow places the blame on the one character who:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Is least involved in the story or</li><li>Has no connection to what has transpired </li><li>Makes for a convenient villain </li><li>Isn’t suspected by anyone in the story and isn’t portrayed to the reader as a potential culprit</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s wonderful when an author can take you by surprise… especially in the case of a mystery novel. But I <strong>wasn’t satisfied with the way this novel concludes</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the plot itself, another aspect of the book that made me pick it up is <strong>Chloe being a psychologist</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I soon learned just how she uses her job to her advantage. For starters, she indulges in quite a bit of substance abuse to manage her anxiety. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoy reading books where the <strong>protagonist becomes a sleuth</strong> of sorts and tries to take matters into their own hands, you might enjoy this one. Although I can understand why Chloe would intervene, she just ends up doing more harm that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the other <strong>characters play problematic roles in some way</strong>. I wished that Chloe had better people around her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In varying levels of detail, the story includes <strong>infidelity, trauma, self-harm, domestic abuse, and substance abuse</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still had a couple of unanswered questions by the end which, combined with who the murdered turned out to be, made the reading experience so-so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, I didn’t like reading <em>A Flicker in the Dark</em> as much as I was hoping to. </p>\n",

I’d been procrastinating about doing so for far too long, and with good reason! I had an inkling that most of its content would be intimidating. Having read The Psychology of Money, I can say that I wasn’t wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Divided into <strong>20 chapters</strong>, the book elaborates on different maxims. From growing your money to saving money, it strives to <strong>improve your financial intelligence through behavioural measures</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that the author emphasizes the <strong>importance of learning personal finance</strong> and addresses how sometimes the approach with which we are taught about money matters can be ineffective due to a lack of attention to underlying governing factors.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>“<em>… we think about and are taught about money in ways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions and nuance).</em>“</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons why I feel that the wisdom in the book is persuasive is that it’s <strong>all linked to historical and economic events</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morgan Housel draws from anecdotes, both personal and of others, in driving home the points he is making. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His <strong>writing is informative, encouraging, and seeks to be relatable</strong>. The way the book is written, i.e. the language or the tone in itself doesn’t make for difficult reading. I felt that the conversational tone makes it more engaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, a lot of the data that is foundational to the arguments the author makes is <strong>very specific to the US</strong>. Of course, no one expects him to write about stats from across the globe – that’s not even feasible. But if you aren’t familiar with the US stock market or the country’s economic trajectory, you might find <strong>some parts of the book to be a tad bit overwhelming</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>“<em>Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy.</em>“</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the topics you’ll read about are <strong>compounding, luck & risk, margin of error, social comparison</strong>, optimism vs. pessimism, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suggest that you don’t go into this book expecting to find tips & tricks that will make you wealthy instantly. Instead, you’ll find sufficient guidance on what behavioural and mindset changes to make. These can be implemented starting now, and <strong>you’ll reap the rewards in the years to come</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand why this book is recommended by everyone. It can be extremely beneficial if you have started/ are about to start becoming financially independent. Just keep in mind that some of the information may not be relevant to you or may not align with the financial laws of your country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having <strong>annotated several passages</strong> throughout the book, I definitely see myself revisiting it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3PyB6Vc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Psychology of Money</a></em> a try, I hope you can make the most of it!</p>\n",

As an avid reader, <strong>books about books</strong> are certainly high up on my reading list. But the way <strong>Bridget Collins weaves magic with her words</strong>, I was spellbound. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an almost <strong>cinematic edge to her writing style</strong>. It is so luxurious and vivid that the world Collins has created opens up in your mind with every scene that she establishes and uses to its full potential. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its <strong>seamless merging of the gothic and the fantastical</strong> made it such an engaging read for me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of “binding”, i.e. writing a book to make memories less painful is beautifully captured in the story. Although, the argument of whether erasing such memories is the way to go about it is debatable. In Emmett’s words, “<em>Who are you to say what they can live with?</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <strong>loved many aspects of this novel</strong> – the writing, the location, and the magic system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these alone, I would highly recommend that you pick it up. But please go into it knowing that the book <strong>requires trigger warnings</strong> for rape, suicidal ideation, and suicide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The novel <strong>has 3 parts</strong>, each of which presents us with a different version of Emmett. And although the book follows a <strong>non-linear narrative style</strong>, I enjoyed being able to form a complete picture of Emmett’s journey and hardships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not going to get into the details of the plot points or what happens in these parts because <strong>going into it without too much knowledge was a lovely surprise</strong> for me, so I’d suggest the same for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way the author incorporates this element of magic also borrows from history and reflects how witches were persecuted in olden times. When Seredith talks about Crusaders hunting binders, you get the gist of how <strong>society will always try to weed out divergence and quell their fears with violence</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <strong>wished that Darnay Senior’s storyline had had an appropriate conclusion</strong>, something befitting the horrendous character that he is. There’s one other element that I didn’t particularly agree with, and it involves deceiving a family member. You’ll probably guess what I mean as you read it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, <strong><em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3Qut4OJ\" target=\"_blank\">The Binding</a></em> is one of the highlights of my 2022 reading</strong>. I will certainly be picking up more of Bridget Collins’ works. </p>\n",

It’s not just Tulsi, Madhav, or any of his million exes, but even Tulsi’s family, the women at the ashram where Tulsi now lives – <strong>none of the characters brings anything likeable </strong>to the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although only 100 pages long, the <strong>novel has several strong themes</strong> (trigger warnings may be needed) such as emotional abuse, suicide, marital rape, and adultery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The narrative begins with Tulsi having settled for life as a religious ascetic. Along the way, the author weaves <strong>ample flashbacks</strong> into the chapters to help us understand how Tulsi met Madhu, what their relationship once looked like, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll probably be as surprised towards the end as I was because it <strong>takes a dark turn</strong>. If only the breadth of the novel had been more engaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t want to give up reading K.R. Meera’s works because she <strong>has a way with using metaphors that I truly appreciate</strong> so I’m still going to pick up <em>The Unseeing Idol of Light</em>.

Here too, <strong>the writing is my favourite aspect</strong> of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any given Austen title, you’ll find that <strong>the passages are longer</strong> than in a typical fiction novel these days, <strong>the sentences are complex</strong>, and what the author is trying to convey is not particularly written in a straightforward manner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <strong>can’t be a passive reader and fully understand the intricacies</strong> of a Jane Austen book. So, be prepared to go the extra mile if you’ve never read one of her works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking of <strong>a society that is just as governed by class hierarchies</strong> and the fixation with “making a good match” between people, Emma is a timeless story. Try living as a single twenty-something today, and there’ll be at least two people around you trying to get you to tie the knot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the beginning, I <strong>knew that Emma would not be one of my favourite Austen protagonists</strong>. She is conceited and hypocritical and presumes to be a great judge of character (spoiler alert – she is not!). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While towards the end of the book, she becomes much more accepting of her faults, it doesn’t redeem her because the way she behaves all throughout is unacceptable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mr Knightley is the one character that I liked</strong> in the book. He has a steadfast presence in Emma’s life, is always trying to guide her, and has a solid worldview that could enrich anybody’s perspective. <br><br><strong>Themes of prejudice and miscommunication are common</strong> in Jane Austen’s books, and they play an integral role in <em>Emma</em> too. This not only has to do with romantic relationships but also in the way several other characters interact with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>primary plot is not layered enough</strong> to sustain a 500-page novel. But because the book gives us <strong>a glimpse into the ordinary lives of more than a handful of characters</strong>, chronicling significant events in their day-to-day, it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>audiobook narrated by Anna Bentinck made the experience even more engaging</strong> for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, I found the book <strong>worth the read</strong> simply because I love Jane Austen’s writing. If you had to pick just one of her titles, I’d any day recommend <em>Pride & Prejudice</em> over this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>A sweeping account of <strong>a family of glassblowers</strong> that chronicles the aftermath of the decisions they take and how the <strong>French Revolution</strong>‘s changing momentum upends the little control they have over their destiny. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Glass-Blowers</em> is a family saga that is <strong>quite unlike most of Daphne du Maurier’s other works</strong> – in style and tone. It has none of the ambience of <em>Rebecca</em>, the suspense of <em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://thelifestories2.wordpress.com/2022/01/06/my-cousin-rachel-by-daphne-du-maurier/\" target=\"_blank\">My Cousin Rachel</a></em>, or even a structure in terms of a plot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>free-flowing narrative</strong> in the novel, devoid of a distinct beginning-middle-end, spans decades. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, the socio-political state of the country felt more like a guiding force than anything else. It was like all the characters were just being swept forward by the tides of changing political scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>“<em>The system might one day change, but human nature remained the same, and there were always people who profited at the expense of others.</em>“</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Magdalene</strong>, Sophie Duval’s mother <strong>has got to be one of my favourite characters</strong> in the book even though she is only present in the first quarter or so. She has a resemblance to the female protagonists that we are used to seeing in du Maurier’s works – driven, outspoken, and ready to find their place in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I was reading, I knew that this would be <strong>by far one of my lowest-rated Daphne du Maurier book</strong>s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several <strong>sections felt too dull</strong>, I didn’t particularly care for most of the characters, and the main reason I kept reading was so that we could discuss the book at our book club.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386608280l/18869976.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Image Courtesy – Goodreads</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While there are <strong>quite a few conflicts</strong> introduced in the story, it <strong>doesn’t do much for the pacing</strong>. At almost no point did I feel apprehensive about what was going to happen or even anticipate the direction of the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the point of introducing a <strong>morally grey character</strong> like Robert and then maintaining his character arc to be pretty much the same throughout the novel was to show that not all people change even after they’ve borne the brunt of consequences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that was the agenda, I can appreciate it. But Robert’s consistent money troubles, irresponsibility, and lack of remorse were certainly off-putting to me. Sophie’s unconditional support of him highlights one of the strongest messages this book sends across – that <strong>blood is indeed thicker than water</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who are familiar with the French Revolution might enjoy the book a lot more as it delves into the details of the opposing powers and the hope that their followers carried.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, it is <strong>well-written as a family saga</strong> and gives you a glimpse of the entire lifetime of a few characters. I’m glad to have picked it up just to know <strong>how diverse du Maurier’s writing</strong> truly can be. </p>\n",

But this is not everything that works for the book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The author’s <strong>writing style is evocative</strong> enough to make you feel what the characters are going through – be it the burning chill of a blizzard or the fear of being hunted down by a serial killer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, it <strong>is unputdownable</strong>. Heather Gudenkauf has written a novel that despite its use of trite elements works splendidly to draw you in and keep you engrossed throughout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not going to talk about the different storylines as it may spoil your reading experience. But know that this novel <strong>follows three storylines parallelly</strong> – one of Wylie in the present as she is secluded in the cabin, one of an anonymous set of characters, and another of a crime that occurred long ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The masterstroke that Gudenkauf pulls is <strong>brilliantly tying these storylines together</strong> by the end. I kept trying to form connections but wasn’t as successful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Overnight Guest is <strong>thrilling and tense in equal measure</strong>. It is well-paced, so plot developments were introduced at regular intervals. Because there are a couple of stories to keep track of, you might think that it is overwhelming. It’s actually not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, it does deal with some sensitive topics. <strong>Trigger warnings needed</strong> are for kidnapping, miscarriage, violence, childhood trauma, and rape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <strong>enough red herrings thrown in</strong> for good measure, so you can’t help but view several of the characters in a suspicious light. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the 2nd last suspect entered the picture, I sort of <strong>guessed who might be the culprit</strong>. But there were a lot more plausible scenarios that could’ve played out to resolve the mystery, which would’ve been far more believable. I <strong>wasn’t as persuaded</strong> by who the killer turned out to be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that slight element, I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Overnight Guest. I’d <strong>highly recommend</strong> it to everyone who is looking for a medium-paced, mystery-thriller that is executed superbly.</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em>When Meddy <strong>agrees to meet the man her mother secretly sets her up with</strong>, she has no idea just how the night is going to end. It so happens that the next day, she and her family <strong>find themselves with a dead body in Meddy’s trunk and a wedding to cater to</strong>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dial A For Aunties</em> is that <strong>fun, lighthearted novel</strong> that you want to carry with you on a vacation. It doesn’t require too much of your brain energy and is quite entertaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found it to be <strong>relatable in its representation of Asian families</strong>. The values and beliefs that Meddy’s family holds dear are quite familiar to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book <strong>is character driven</strong>. Meddy’s mother and aunties are a driving force, propelling the story forward. There is <strong>a lot of bickering that goes on</strong> amongst them, which added mild tension to the plot progression. Just when you think that they’ve found a way out, something else would go wrong. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1601307658l/53310061.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"321\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image Courtesy – Goodreads</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>These <strong>apprehension-causing elements certainly kept me more engrossed</strong> in the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’d think that with Meddy’s family being a stickler for rules in many ways and their traditional thinking, they would have a bit more of a hard time coming to terms with the death. But the ease with which they move forward was an interesting addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <strong>enjoy reading stories that are set around events, especially a wedding</strong>. The way this is incorporated into the plot makes the book even more fun!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>writing is humorous at times</strong>. Jesse Q. Sutanto has left no leaf unturned in bringing out the most real and personal aspects of Meddy’s family dynamics. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I <strong>wasn’t a fan of Meddy and Nathan’s romantic storyline</strong>. It didn’t feel convincing, and I don’t think made much of a difference to the novel as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe if there were a few more meaningful scenes about them that added some weight to their history, it would’ve been great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Meddy being compelled to find a partner, having to work in her family’s business, and their firm adherence to hierarchy, there are <strong>a few <strong>stereotypical</strong></strong> <strong>themes</strong>. But that’s to be expected. This is the lived reality for thousands of people today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found Dial A For Aunties to be worth the read and interesting enough to keep an eye out for whatever Jesse Q. Sutanto writes next. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick it up if you’re looking for <strong>a comedy of errors style contemporary novel</strong>.</p>\n",

What follows is a quick glimpse into <strong>Joe’s philandering ways</strong> and the havoc that he wrecks.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy reading books set in different regions of the world. What I got to see of <strong>Lagos of the 1960s</strong> made the story engaging just as much as Joe’s character made it displeasing. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"3598\" data-permalink=\"http://thelifestories.blog/2022/05/22/glittering-city-by-cyprian-ekwensi/glittering-city-review-short-story/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"3024,3024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.7","credit":"","camera":"SM-G935F","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1657053867","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.2","iso":"250","shutter_speed":"0.090909090909091","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"glittering-city-review-short-story\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg?w=1024\" src=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3598\" width=\"397\" height=\"397\" srcset=\"https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg?w=397 397w, https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg?w=794 794w, https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://thelifestories2.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/glittering-city-review-short-story.jpeg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" /></a><figcaption>Copyright © 2022 Meera Nair</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The author doesn’t attempt at creating a redemption arc for Joe at any point. And so, it is pretty evident from the beginning that Joe’s story is being narrated for the sake of storytelling and not to make his character seem likeable to the reader. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering that this story is a little over 50 pages long, it certainly is a quick read. This is further reinforced by the fact that a <strong>significant percentage of the writing involves dialogues</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The woman characters in the book are portrayed in a way to justify the image created of Joe – they repeatedly allow themselves to be persuaded by Joe’s lies. You are <strong>probably not going to like any of the characters</strong> in the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A part of me does like the author’s writing style because the culture and backdrop of the story come across vividly. But I also <strong>wished that there was more to the story</strong> than just the gradual downfall of a character.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, it was an okay read. I <strong>wouldn’t  recommend it</strong>.</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p><em><strong>12-year-old Oskar’s new neighbour is a strange young girl</strong>. He only ever sees her out and about at night.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When the boys at his school increase their efforts in bullying him, Eli’s presence by his side is a steadfast pillar of strength. But soon, he realizes just why she seems so mysterious and what truth is lurking beneath her quiet disposition.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book had been on my TBR for ages before I finally picked it up. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331404515l/9441425.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"217\" height=\"332\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image Courtesy – Goodreads</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A <strong>Swedish historical-fiction, fantasy novel</strong>, it weaves <strong>a gory tale</strong> around the friendship between an almost-teen boy and a 200-year-old vampire. While it seems like an odd pairing, Eli’s nature makes their friendship believable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running parallel to Oskar’s story is that of <strong>a series of murders occurring in town</strong>. And soon, you begin to put two and two together as these storylines intersect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t read any Swedish books before. I’ve never been to Sweden. So it was interesting to see glimpses of the place and its customs through this translated work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, fair warning. Those of you who have picked this up because you either like fantasy novels or are fond of vampire fiction might be disappointed. The <strong>fantasy aspect of the novel isn’t front and centre</strong>. It’s a secondary plot point that mostly is used to drive Oskar’s character arc. I actually found this approach to be quite intriguing. Especially since the vampire character isn’t whom you’d usually peg to be a vampire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is compelling about the novel is the way it <strong>lays bare the truth about parental neglect and bullying</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The portrayal of the children reminded me of Golding’s <em>Lord of the Flies</em> – a system bereft of order upheld by unruly kids. They aren’t even seniors. How then do school authorities have no grip over what goes on amidst their students ON SCHOOL PREMISES???</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Ajvide Lindqvist’s <strong>writing has a long-winded, rustic tone</strong> to it. It is focused on details about setting and character motivations, which somehow felt a little reminiscent of Stephen King’s writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of chapters felt dull and draggy. But I was curious about how things would pan out and how many of the characters would fit into the conclusion. So I <strong>had enough and more reasons to remain engaged</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some <strong>content warnings you should be mindful of</strong> – paedophilia, gore, sexual assault, and misgendering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let the Right One In <strong>wasn’t what I’d pictured it to be</strong>. Nevertheless, on the whole, it was a good first book to pick by a Swedish author.</p>\n",

In my heart, I already knew this, but in unpacking and repacking my shelves I have had to face the reality of the situation. In 2020 I had a go at The Quiet Pond’s <a href=\"https://tintededges.com/2020/12/31/2020-a-year-in-books/\">#StartOnYourShelfathon</a> challenge and managed to get through 21 books languishing on my shelf (which was over a quarter of my books read for the year). This year, I’m trying a new challenge: <a href=\"https://tintededges.com/reading-challenges/\">The Mount TBR Reading Challenge</a>. I am not doing very well so far! It has been a busy and challenging year so far but I have finally had a bit of time to try to get back in the swing of reading. I was looking for some inspiration to help me choose my next book and this book caught my eye after reading about the <a href=\"https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/1984/07/Siracusa-principles-ICCPR-legal-submission-1985-eng.pdf\">Siracusa Principles</a> recently for work. I can’t quite remember where this book came from (perhaps an ARC from Harry Hartog?) but it will hopefully be the first of many form my to-read list. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"8970\" data-permalink=\"http://tintededges.com/wp-1652614792547/\" data-orig-file=\"https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.9","credit":"","camera":"SM-A205YN","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1652639125","copyright":"","focal_length":"3.6","iso":"64","shutter_speed":"0.058823529411765","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"wp-1652614792547\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8970\" srcset=\"https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg 2048w, https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg?w=150 150w, https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg?w=300 300w, https://tintededges.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652614792547.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption>Image is of “Siracusa” by Delia Ephron.

Behind the board a wine glass rests on its side with the dregs of red wine still inside.  </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Siracusa” by Delia Ephron is a thriller novel about two couples who decide to holiday together in Italy. When Journalist Lizzie and renowned writer Michael find out their friends Finn, Taylor and their daughter Snow are going to be in Europe at the same time, they organise a trip together in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily\">Siracusa</a>, Italy. However, as the book progresses it becomes clear that the trip may not have been as innocent as it initially seemed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This novel was told from the perspective of each of the adult characters, with Lizzie, Michael, Finn and Taylor each offering their take and thoughts on the events of the trip. Ephron is a clear writer and draws on the seascape and architecture of the city to underpin the growing tension in the novel between and among the two couples. Although she didn’t get any point-of-view chapters, by far the most compelling character is Snow. There seems to be an inexplicable discrepancy between how the characters talk about her and the things that she does and this, I believe, is the most interesting thing about the book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, ultimately I felt the book frustrating and hard to finish. All four characters are inherently unlikeable, and it is a strange position to be in when you find yourself spitefully hoping that characters cheat on each other. I’m not sure the structure of four points of view worked; even though it is a relatively short book, the chapters seemed to drag the same dirt over and over. I also didn’t find the voices distinct enough from one another to be truly compelling or to provide unique insight into the ill-fated trip. There was something quite uncomfortable about the way Michael and 10-year-old Snow interacted with each other. While all the characters applaud Michael for the “special attention” that he gives to Snow, the way their discussions are described (including, at one point, as a “flirtation”) just felt ick to be honest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A novel with plenty of the pieces of a compelling story but perhaps not the right. </p>\n",

Was it suicide? A murder? Six mysterious characters, who rent units in, or are connected to, the self-storage facility, must now reevaluate their lives. We meet Serge, an unstable but brilliant street photographer who lives in his unit, which overflows with thousands of undeveloped pictures; Zach, the building’s owner, who develops Serge’s photos as he searches for clues to the accident; Marta, an undocumented immigrant who is finishing her dissertation and hiding from ICE; Liddy, an abused wife and mother, who recreates her children’s bedroom in her unit; Jason, who has left his corporate firm and now practices law from his storage unit; and Rose, the office manager, who takes kickbacks to let renters live in the building and has her own complicated family history.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The characters have a variety of backgrounds: they are different races; they practice different religions; they’re young and they’re not so young; they are rich, poor, and somewhere in the middle. As they dip in and out of one another’s lives, fight circumstances that are within and also beyond their control, and try to discover the details of the accident, Shapiro both dismantles the myth of the American dream and builds tension to an exciting climax.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>——–</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>🏢 <strong>Put a diverse cast of characters in an unusual setting, and you’ve got a page-turner! It’s a voyeuristic look at these characters’ lives, memories, and, well stuff. But there is a mystery at hand! Written from several perspectives, it gives off a modern Clue-like feel. I enjoyed getting to know each of these characters and seeing how their lives intersected.</strong> <strong>Shapiro’s writing is vivid and creative, making this story come alive for me.</strong></p>\n",

If so, then it’s more true than ever lately as I find my free time diminished and my workday lengthened by an untimely staff death. Once again, the universe has unveiled a nasty streak of larceny aimed at my time.</p>\n<p>That theft has not yet driven me to oxymoronic forms (i.e., audiobooks) but it has driven me to more than one “book” stored on my phone. As my dear departed colleague, herself an avid reader, liked to say,  “You spend so much time waiting you ought to at least have a book with you.” That notion, and a bargain-basement price, explain the present volume.</p>\n<p>More than once I’ve referenced the role <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong></em></a> played in my development as a young professional. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/news/author/gerald-f-seib\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Gerald Seib</strong></a>, the author of this book, is presently the Executive Washington Editor for the paper and for a long time penned a weekly column on doings in the capital city. He’s precisely the sort of person you meet riding the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acela\"><strong>Acela</strong></a> corridor, where I literally once bumped into him.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_11415\" style=\"width: 160px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11415\" data-attachment-id=\"11415\" data-permalink=\"https://anhonestcon.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/forces-of-chaos-and-anarchy/g_seib_wsj_dots/\" data-orig-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/g_seib_wsj_dots.png\" data-orig-size=\"450,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"G_Seib_WSJ_dots\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Gerald Seib in the iconic WSJ dot llustration style.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/g_seib_wsj_dots.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/g_seib_wsj_dots.png?w=450\" class=\"wp-image-11415 size-thumbnail\" src=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/g_seib_wsj_dots.png?w=150\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/g_seib_wsj_dots.png?w=150 150w, https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/g_seib_wsj_dots.png?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-11415\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gerald Seib in the iconic WSJ dot illustration style.</p></div></p>\n<p>Here Seib provides <em>his </em>version of our recent politics. Political journalists are always tossing off lengthier versions of the first draft of history and the longer form doesn’t necessarily improve things. How can I say this kindly? Journalists are concerned with a coherent storyline. The tale’s the thing. They often ask important questions. But the analysis is typically less satisfying than I like.</p>\n<p>You could rightfully argue that they’re doing their job and if they find an expert willing to lend <em>their</em> interpretation then there’s no issue. I’m willing to accept that. It just strikes me as thin gruel. Maybe it’s why newspapers seem less vital to me now.</p>\n<p>In any case, Seib essentially uses his own career as a frame for the transformation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Republican</strong></a> politics over the last 4 decades. That’s basically from the “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Reagan revolution</strong></a>” to the age of “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Make America Great Again</strong></a>.” I don’t want to pick fights, but anyone who sees these poles as two sides of the same coin, or as a story of mutation-free evolution, isn’t thinking clearly. They do, though, begin with a common impulse: throw the rascals out.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_11417\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11417\" data-attachment-id=\"11417\" data-permalink=\"https://anhonestcon.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/forces-of-chaos-and-anarchy/cwa/\" data-orig-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cwa.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"CWA\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>You could start a discussion of opposition and rage at the Contract With America.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cwa.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cwa.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-11417\" src=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cwa.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cwa.jpg?w=300 300w, https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cwa.jpg?w=600 600w, https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/cwa.jpg?w=150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-11417\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">You could start a discussion of opposition and rage at the Contract With America.</p></div></p>\n<p>The story Seib tells is, by now,  familiar. Mid-century <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Eisenhower</strong></a>/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_club_Republican\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Country Club Republicans</strong> </a>find themselves suddenly eclipsed by a group that so spectacularly lost the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_United_States_presidential_election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1964 Presidential election</a> that any sort of resurrection seemed beyond fanciful.  If you’d told anyone in 1964 that Republicans would be in control in less than 20 years you’d have been thought bonkers. Yet you might question that achievement when you consider what came next.</p>\n<p>First, there was the rise of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newt_Gingrich\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Newt Gingrich</strong></a>.  A would-be professor turned politician representing suburban <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Atlanta</strong></a>, Gingrich engineered a stunning Republican takeover of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>House</strong></a>. That was just a prelude to turning himself into a legislative <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Icarus</strong></a>. But before immolating his political career Gingrich spurred real changes in legislation and in how the House operated.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_11419\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11419\" data-attachment-id=\"11419\" data-permalink=\"https://anhonestcon.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/forces-of-chaos-and-anarchy/gfc/\" data-orig-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/gfc.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"474,402\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"GFC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Adding fuel to the fire.

One thing that fascinates me is cultural persistence. I’ve worked in at least two organizations that, in the name of self-preservation, decreed wholesale revolutions and overturned the majority of the staff. And yet years later self-defeating behaviors and policies remained in place. Why should the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>United States Congress</strong></a> be any different?</p>\n<p>Yet the underlying anger kept simmering and exploded again in the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Global Financial Crisis</strong></a>. There are many ways to understand that mess. I’m particularly fond of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harvey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>David Harvey</strong></a>‘s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qOP2V_np2c0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marxist </a>interpretation which manages to cram in every trope I learned from the red diaper baby brigade I studied with into 11 entertaining minutes. No matter the explanation, what’s indisputable was the outcome. The malefactors–the financial elites–got bailed out, collectively, by the little people.</p>\n<p>As a business acquaintance from the southeast always says, “Tain’t right.” And so the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement\"><strong>Tea Party</strong> </a>movement emerged. In Seib’s telling the electoral success of the TPM in the 2010 midterms should have awakened everyone. Here was a group that could be,  and has been,  defined in many ways. Yet I haven’t seen a lot of use of the word i believe best describes their outlook: nihilism.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_11412\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://youtu.be/29E6GbYdB1c\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11412\" data-attachment-id=\"11412\" data-permalink=\"https://anhonestcon.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/forces-of-chaos-and-anarchy/horsefeathers-groucho/\" data-orig-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/horsefeathers-groucho.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"628,475\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"HorseFeathers-Groucho\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>The great professor.<br />\nWhatever it is, he’s agianst it.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/horsefeathers-groucho.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/horsefeathers-groucho.jpg?w=628\" class=\"wp-image-11412 size-medium\" src=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/horsefeathers-groucho.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/horsefeathers-groucho.jpg?w=300 300w, https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/horsefeathers-groucho.jpg?w=600 600w, https://anhonestcon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/horsefeathers-groucho.jpg?w=150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-11412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The great professor.<br />Whatever it is, he’s against it.

However well-intentioned the present-day punditry may be in describing what they’re observing, their framing is very often too limited to “It started with _________” fill in the blank. Sometimes you get a half-hearted nod towards wanting to return to some mythic golden age, maybe the 1920s, more often the 1880s.</p>\n<p>Such attitudes are neither recent nor novel.</p>\n<p>Long before the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority#Richard_Nixon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Silent Majority</a>, the Regan Revolution,  the Gingrich years and the Tea Party there was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80th_United_States_Congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>80th Congress</strong>,</a> in the infamous formulation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Truman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Harry Truman</strong></a> the “do nothing 80th Congress.”  Which is not entirely fair. What they spent an awful lot of time doing was passing laws and Constitutional amendments related to the Presidency. They actually did pass a lot of important national security acts, too. But domestically. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Taft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Robert A. Taft</strong> </a>and his colleagues would have executed a U-turn if they could have.

The most eloquent travel writer in Britain—there can be no argument after the death last year of Jan Morris—he set out at the age of nearly 80 to traverse a river 2,826 miles long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Amur River: Between Russia and China By Colin Thubron</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&tag=wsj09-20&field-isbn=9780063099685\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=189983X1661674&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fs%2F9780063099685\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=189983X1661674&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booksamillion.com%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3D9780063099685\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=189983X1661674&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fbooks%3Fkeywords%3D9780063099685\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-406018\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is “The Amur River,” whose subject, the world’s 10th longest river, forms the border between Russia and China—“a fault-line,” Mr. Thubron writes, “shrouded in old mistrust.” With ruminative gracefulness, he describes his eastward journey from the Amur’s “sacred” source in Mongolia to the near-dead port of Nikolaevsk-on-Amur on Russia’s Eastern Coast. It is here that the river decants into the Sea of Okhotsk with a “sense of thwarted purpose”—as if “all human life dwindled away at its colossal estuary.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Thubron traveled for the most part in great pain, having broken an ankle and fractured two ribs within days of starting his journey in Mongolia. His horse had lost its footing in swampland and “tilted sideways in that rotting earth,” pinning Mr. Thubron under its body. One foot still in the stirrups, the doughty Englishman was saved by a loose-fitting shoe from being dragged to death. It came off his foot as the horse began to bolt. “I lay in the marsh,” he writes, “oddly at peace.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His tranquility was based, in part, on a misconception: He didn’t realize that his ankle was broken and ribs cracked until months later, having assumed that they were merely bruised. His physical pain also found a psychic salve in the Amur, whose rugged beauty enchants him even as its history fills him with dread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No detail escapes Mr. Thubron, whether botanical, atmospheric or homicidal. “To walk here,” he writes of a Mongolian hillside, “is to wade through a tide of wildflowers: multicolored asters, gentians, butter-coloured potentilla, peacock-blue columbines.” In an eastern Russian town, his lodging is “a gaunt room, asthmatic with dust.” But his explorer’s eye fastens just as swiftly on the ugliness of the Amur’s human past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He laments, for instance, the fate of the Buryat Mongols, whose history is “dark with flight and persecution.” An ethnic sub-group, they fought alongside the White Russians against the Reds in 1917. Stalin exacted his revenge by banishing thousands to gulags in the eastern reaches of the Amur. Many Buryats hid their genealogies, “erasing their own past in a severance that is even now unhealed.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Thubron is unsparing in his account of a massacre in the Russian town of Blagoveshchensk in 1900. Maverick insurgents of the Boxer Rebellion had shelled the Russian shore from across the Amur, and the townsfolk panicked. Overnight, writes Mr. Thubron, their fear transformed the town’s Chinese residents, “trusted and peaceful until now,” into an “imminent peril.” Cossacks marched 5,000 Chinese men, women and children into the Amur River: Most couldn’t swim and were axed, shot and bayoneted to death. In Blagoveshchensk, notes Mr. Thubron, “all knowledge of this slaughter has thinned into oblivion.” The local museum makes no note of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amur was Chinese for many years. By the Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689—the first treaty that China concluded with a European power—“the parvenu Russian and the ancient Chinese” empires agreed that the river would belong to China. So, too, would all land north of the Amur up to the Stanovoy Mountains many hundreds of miles away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russia would reverse this humiliation in 1858, when it recovered all the lands ceded to China nearly two centuries before by a treaty that the Chinese still regard as “unequal.” In his travels, Mr. Thubron constantly notes the hatred that many Russians have for the Chinese. Some of it is the product of xenophobia, but its root lies in this history of competition for land. Intermarriage, Mr. Thubron tells us, is rare, “although some Russian women declare a preference for Chinese men, more diligent and sober than their own.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chinese now dominate commerce in Russia’s Amur-bank towns, adding to local concern for the future. The Russian provinces along the Amur are home to barely two million. The Chinese provinces opposite hold 110 million. “The old phantom of a Yellow Peril,” writes Mr. Thubron, “has returned.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While more at home in the company of Russians, whose language he speaks, Mr. Thubron is elegantly neutral on these demographic questions. Where he does show a bias—bordering on rapture—is in his love for the river. As he basks in the vast emptiness of the lands that are its cradle, you can’t help thinking that the world of the Amur is the perfect country for old men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Varadarajan, a Journal contributor, is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and at NYU Law School’s Classical Liberal Institute.</p>\n",

I want their contents to enter my mind by osmosis, to possess their insights into the past without having to wrap my brain around blocks of dry factual text. But that changes when a book articulates history in a way that makes it leap from the page, the sights and sounds and smells of the past made shockingly, almost painfully, present. Such is the case with ‘Stasiland’. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:25% auto;\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1171\" data-permalink=\"http://emwithpen.com/2022/05/15/history-that-lives-rereading-stasiland-by-anna-funder/stasiland/\" data-orig-file=\"https://emwithpencom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/stasiland.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"323,500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"stasiland\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://emwithpencom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/stasiland.jpeg?w=194\" data-large-file=\"https://emwithpencom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/stasiland.jpeg?w=323\" src=\"https://emwithpencom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/stasiland.jpeg?w=323\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1171 size-large\" srcset=\"https://emwithpencom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/stasiland.jpeg 323w, https://emwithpencom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/stasiland.jpeg?w=97 97w, https://emwithpencom.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/stasiland.jpeg?w=194 194w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>Title</strong>: Stasiland: Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall<br><strong>Author</strong>: Anna Funder<br><strong>Genre</strong>: Historical / Journalistic / True stories<br><strong>Published by</strong>: Granta Books (UK)<br><strong>Publication date</strong>: 5 June 2003 (earlier in Australia)<br><strong>Length</strong>: 304 pages</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the mid-nineties, still just a handful of years since the fall of the Berlin wall, when the author, Anna Funder, was working in television in Berlin. She became interested in the world of the recent past: the former East Berlin, and its ministry of security – the Stasi. By placing an ad in a paper she managed to arrange meetings with a number of former Stasi men, which then led to also meeting some of the survivors of their furtive and controlling regime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through these meetings, Funder paints a very personal picture of life in East Germany before the wall came down. Among those she speaks to are Miriam, who was condemned as an enemy of the state at sixteen, Frau Paul, separated from her baby by the wall, and Hagen Koch, ex-Stasi man whose council flat was now a museum to the old regime. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>East Germany still felt like a secret walled-in garden, a place lost in time. It wouldn’t have surprised me if things had tasted different here – apples like pears, say, or wine like blood.</p><cite>‘Stasiland’, Anna Funder</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether ex-Stasi or victim of the Stasi, the stories are told with detail and empathy. There’s a duality in the history told here: one part the story of East Germany while it still existed, one part the story of Funder’s mid-nineties present – the aftermath of the wall coming down and the attempts of former East Germans to live in the new world with the knowledge and lasting effects of their past. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s this that makes the book so affecting to me. The two timelines laced around each other, articulated through Funder’s vibrant, immediate writing style, bring these layers of history to life. It also gets around the worry I sometimes have, when reading history books, about what the sources are, and to what extent the statements of the historian are fact as opposed to interpretation. Funder tells us the story of her journalistic enquiry right alongside the stories that where the subject of that enquiry, and so the sources are right there in front of us, for us to assess as we wish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d love to read more books that explore the past in this way. It’s a style of writing history that I particularly enjoy.</p>\n",

It is situated in a position that lets me see out to the balcony while a well-placed mirror allows me to see the birds who grace me with their songs and their joyful little natures. It is a delightful view and a wonderful distraction to the ramblings of my currently rather tired mind. Activity is an occupation I shall not be indulging in for some weeks to come and although I have never craved 100-mile hikes, I would be happy right now if I could just make it to the laundry room without feeling the three flights of stairs getting there and back possesses the same attributes as climbing Kanchenjunga.<br>Before my readers puzzle over my cryptic writing, I shall be open enough to admit I have recently undergone surgery to remove an organ which chose to misbehave and was causing me enough misery for me to agree with the medical profession that removal was the best course of action. As hysterectomies are quite common and a thoroughly run of the mill procedure everyone is familiar with, I shall not bore you any further. What the literature and all the learned pundits neglect to mention is what it actually means to rest for 6 weeks. Easier said than done, my friends. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, a chair does not a balcony make. Though I do admit, these are quite comfortable particularly as they require no effort to turn into a lounge chair.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-attachment-id=\"671\"

With habitats disappearing and with so many people choosing concrete over greenery while resorting to the excuse “I don’t have a green thumb,” I decided I would do something to change a little piece of the planet, namely the patch I occupy.  Now before anyone asks, which they might, my balcony is west facing. However, I grow lavender, marigolds, nasturtiums and morning glories without any problems. Even north-facing balconies have a whole plethora of plants which will be perfectly happy with more shade. With a little thought and consideration, even the smallest balcony in the least desirable direction can be turned into a refuge, not just for birds and bees but for you.<br>I feed the birds year-round. Yes, that might seem accessive but they do get a reduced diet in the summer. There are many schools of thought on this. Most people believe birds find enough food in their general environs, which is essentially true but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/advice/how-you-can-help-birds/feeding-birds/when-to-feed-garden-birds/\">https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/advice/how-you-can-help-birds/feeding-birds/when-to-feed-garden-birds/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switzerland is the land of beautiful scenery and lovely cheese but it is also the home to ridiculous weather. We can have 28°C today and snow tomorrow, as we did last year when it snowed in June. It is erratic, to say the least, and no, it did not start when everyone started calling it global warming. Switzerland has a rather interesting geography and much of what happens is thanks to those glorious mountains, everyone marvels at. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/climate/the-climate-of-switzerland.html#:~:text=Switzerland’s%20climate%20is%20heavily%20influenced,winter%20falls%20mainly%20as%20snow\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/climate/the-climate-of-switzerland.html#:~:text=Switzerland’s%20climate%20is%20heavily%20influenced,winter%20falls%20mainly%20as%20snow</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is in fact so interesting our meteorological department calls it the “Specialities of the Swiss Climate”.<br>“<strong>Swiss climate is characterised by a number of regularly occurring weather patterns and other routinely occurring phenomena: They range from snowfall during spring, a cold snap in June to fog and Indian summer in autumn. The weather service MeteoSchweiz is analysing these events and putting them into longer-term climatological context.</strong>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/climate/the-climate-of-switzerland/specialties-of-the-swiss-climate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/climate/the-climate-of-switzerland/specialties-of-the-swiss-climate.html</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or as those of us who live here,  just call it “psycho weather”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With such bizarre climactic behaviour, it is even more important to be vigilant of the effects it has on the little creatures who do not have comfy heated houses and full fridges. There is nothing sadder than watching a bird pecking a bone dry earth in the vain hope of finding breakfast. I populate my flower pots with earthworms as often as possible – good for my plants and a larder for my birds.  As for the bees, the bee hotel is a new venture. I did not expect it to be populated but decided I would give it a try anyway. What I have learned thus far – place it in a quiet, sunny, sheltered spot and in your life, no matter how curious you are, leave it alone. You don’t like people peeping in your windows either.<br>It is not a “no maintenance family fun project” as my neighbours believe, who have stuck their bee home next to the kiddy sandpit in the garden and sadly close to the outside barbecue. They haven’t had any success with theirs.  Bees and insects are what give us our flowers and essentially our food too.  They need the right environment to live and they deserve as much respect as you would give your four-legged friends. An insect home requires a little work. I would like to thank the Entomologist Lounge for giving me the tools to start my own.<br><br><a href=\"https://entomologistlounge.wordpress.com/2017/09/18/insect-hotels-a-refuge-or-a-fad/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://entomologistlounge.wordpress.com/2017/09/18/insect-hotels-a-refuge-or-a-fad/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I am not militant nor radical even though my words might appear so. I just feel sad that with so little you can do so much more. A pot of lavender on your windowsill isn’t much effort. And it looks pretty. Sucks to not having a green thumb. I don’t believe you. You learn about plants and if you listen, they will teach you. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":196094389,\"permalink\":\"https:\\/\\/thoughtsdepart.wordpress.com\\/2022\\/05\\/15\\/green-thumbs-and-well-thumbed-books\\/\"}'   class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-3 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"691\" data-permalink=\"https://thoughtsdepart.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/green-thumbs-and-well-thumbed-books/img_20220515_122419/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_122419.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3648,2736\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"img_20220515_122419\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_122419.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_122419.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"691\"  src=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_122419.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-691\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"692\" data-permalink=\"https://thoughtsdepart.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/green-thumbs-and-well-thumbed-books/img_20220515_122411/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_122411.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2736,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"img_20220515_122411\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_122411.jpg?w=225\" data-large-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_122411.jpg?w=768\" data-id=\"692\"  src=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_122411.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-692\" /></figure>\n<figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption\">Windowsill plants.

in a rage – my books are not in order! They are stacked haphazardly in inadequate cubbyholes! Dewy decimal has been abandoned for wanton randomness. Well, I can find what I am looking for. And before you ask, yes I have read all of them, some of them several times.  You don’t just invite your friends for dinner once in a lifetime either. I keep books I know I will read again. Please note there is a singular lack of modern Western literature.  I simply can’t get my head around most of it. Besides Anita Desai is a better writer of characters than E.L. James ever will be. And I don’t have to be ashamed to own Desai’s books.  Unfortunately, I believe what people read says a lot about who they are. I know my collection puts me squarely in the <em>“antiquated, old dear who likes a little fantasy on the side,”</em> if that is a category – if it isn’t, I just invented it. I won’t tell you what I think of people who staunchly declare 50 Shades of Grey is a fine piece of literature. This is, after all, a friendly post. Have I read that book? Someone left a copy on the train once. I browsed through it and if I had been born with no manners I would have laughed hysterically.  I especially enjoyed reading <br><br> “<strong>“And from a very tiny, underused part of my brain – probably located at the base of my medulla oblongata near where my subconscious dwells – comes the thought: He’s here to see you.”</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very tiny and underused indeed.  <br>I was thinking of keeping the copy to style a drinking game from it – find the most rubbish quote and take a very large drink. Instead, I threw it in the bin. So no, I have not read the whole book. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want raw realism, I will take Shasthi Brata.  When I am homesick, I have Ruskin Bond. When it rains, I can turn to W.Somerset Maugham. I have Kipling when I want to travel and Neil Gaiman when I want to go away. G.W.Dalqhust takes me on wonderous penny dreadful journies of harrowing adventures. Richard Holmes feeds my historical moments, and Charles Allen fills in the gaps. Victorian ghost stories hold more horror than anything on Elm Street. There are books for joy, for tears and for rage. My well-thumbed friends to whom I owe the very salvation of my soul for solace for any occasion.  Many of these I have carted around the world and shall continue to do so as long as life permits. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":196094389,\"permalink\":\"https:\\/\\/thoughtsdepart.wordpress.com\\/2022\\/05\\/15\\/green-thumbs-and-well-thumbed-books\\/\"}'   class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-15 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"732\" data-permalink=\"https://thoughtsdepart.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/green-thumbs-and-well-thumbed-books/img_20220515_132137/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132137.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3648,2736\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.6","credit":"","camera":"VOG-L29","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1652620898","copyright":"","focal_length":"5.56","iso":"400","shutter_speed":"0.04","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"img_20220515_132137\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132137.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132137.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"732\"  src=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132137.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-732\" srcset=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132137.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132137.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132137.jpg?w=150 150w, https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132137.jpg?w=300 300w, https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132137.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"733\" data-permalink=\"https://thoughtsdepart.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/green-thumbs-and-well-thumbed-books/img_20220515_132130/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132130.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3648,2736\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.6","credit":"","camera":"VOG-L29","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1652620892","copyright":"","focal_length":"5.56","iso":"320","shutter_speed":"0.02","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"img_20220515_132130\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132130.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132130.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"733\"  src=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132130.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-733\" srcset=\"https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132130.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132130.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132130.jpg?w=150 150w, https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132130.jpg?w=300 300w, https://thoughtsdepart.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_20220515_132130.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also own encyclopedias and various dictionaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cylcopedias in hand, I believe I can weather the most boring of days.

When she saves the life of a cowardly prince, she draws the attention of his powerful father, the sultan, who blackmails her into finding an ancient lamp that has the power to revive the barren land—at the cost of sacrificing all jinn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no choice but to obey or be executed, Loulie journeys with the sultan’s oldest son to find the artifact. Aided by her bodyguard, who has secrets of his own, they must survive ghoul attacks, outwit a vengeful jinn queen, and confront a malicious killer from Loulie’s past. And, in a world where story is reality and illusion is truth, Loulie will discover that everything—her enemy, her magic, even her own past—is not what it seems, and she must decide who she will become in this new reality.

But, just in case, I wanted to show it to you one more time before its release this coming Tuesday, the 17th of May. This story is inspired by stories from One Thousand and One Nights and it sounds like it is going to be legendary. The trade of illegal magic, a cowardly prince, the evil sultan, and an ancient lamp with a terrible cost, and a vengeful jinn queen are all to be found in this book. Even just reading the description makes me feel like I’m being taken away on a magical journey. I’m putting it out there now, this is a five star prediction from me!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://literaryweaponry.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/divider.jpg?w=656&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2&zoom=2\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Chelsea Abdullah:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img data-attachment-id=\"17062\" data-permalink=\"http://literaryweaponry.com/2022/05/15/book-spotlight-the-stardust-thief-the-sandsea-trilogy-1-by-chelsea-abdullah/attachment/21632010/\" data-orig-file=\"https://literaryweaponry.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/21632010.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"200,187\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"5","credit":"","camera":"NIKON D3300","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1561226540","copyright":"","focal_length":"30","iso":"400","shutter_speed":"0.01","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"21632010\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://literaryweaponry.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/21632010.jpg?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https://literaryweaponry.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/21632010.jpg?w=200\" src=\"https://literaryweaponry.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/21632010.jpg?w=200\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17062 size-full\" srcset=\"https://literaryweaponry.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/21632010.jpg 200w, https://literaryweaponry.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/21632010.jpg?w=150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p><strong>Chelsea Abdullah</strong> is an American-Kuwaiti writer born and raised in Kuwait, where she grew up listening to stories about mysterious desert creatures and wily (only sometimes likable) heroes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Consumed by wanderlust, she has put down roots in various states.

Yet that’s exactly what happens. Sloane becomes closest to Vera, a social-media star who lights up any room, and Gabe, Vera’s twin brother and the most serious person Sloane’s ever met. When a beloved painting by the twins’ late mother goes missing, Sloane takes on the responsibility of tracking it down, a journey that takes her across state lines—and ever deeper into the twins’ lives. Filled with intense and important friendships, a wonderful warts-and-all family, shiveringly good romantic developments, and sharp, witty dialogue, this story is about finding the people you never knew you needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“Are you kidding? The trouble was the best part.”</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><br>What a sweet and wholesome read! I decided to pick this one up as an <em>audiobook</em> as I was browsing my options and I’m so happy I did. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a while since I picked up a YA contemporary book but this one was worth it. It brings together friendship, family, adventure, a sprinkle of confusion while gravitating life and different paths, and that extra laughter and it creates this beautiful story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are characters whom you’ll love more and more as the story goes on; there will be moments when you feel their frustration, their doubts will perhaps echo yours – but their friend group dynamic is what shines the brightest. The way they all learn how to carry each other. Or…just be there for one another. I loved the realism in the group dynamics, in how friendships were depicted. Friendships are tough to navigate, they require a lot of effort from both sides, honesty and the bravery to express emotions and thoughts. All of that was present in this book! </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“We should all find something to be weirdly passionate about, don’t you think?”</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Sloane was so relatable at times and so fascinating to follow throughout the story! Seeing the events through her eyes was such a unique experience; one of the most unique narrators in YA contemporary I’d say. This book did another thing beautifully: the secondary characters! In fact, it was so well-done they felt like main characters as well. Like a one-of-a-kind ensemble we followed around and whose adventures we were mesmerised by. I loved their individual stories and everything they brought to the group. We all need friends like that, right?? The parents too: Sloane’s interactions with her dad was so wholesome and cheesily cute! Best dad award! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fully recommend checking this book out! Plus, the audiobook was marvellous too! </p>\n",

This book is a murder mystery following the death of Delilah, who had been the most popular person in New Seattle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">New Seattle’s entire system is based around how popular you are, with the most popular people getting the best housing and the top ten (or Tenners) getting the ability to govern the city. The least popular, well, get exiled out of the city, and don’t survive long. Delilah’s death kickstarts a chain reaction among the city and Scottie ends up trying to solve the murder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Probably my favourite bit about this is Scottie’s AI companion, named Watson because Scottie really, really likes Sherlock and pretends to be Sherlock while solving the crime. It was a small but consistent character beat that I enjoyed; of course it made me really want to re-read my Sherlock Holmes collection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I feel like the wrong person to review this. This is a case of a book simply not clicking with a reader. I can absolutely see people interested in these dynamics of popularity (along the lines of the Nosedive episode of Black Mirror.) really enjoying this book, and I do hope it finds an audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\"><em>Once again I would like to thank Ryan for his reviews of our semi-finalists.

This is the 2nd book I read about the power of literature during WWII. The only difference is that The Paris Library focuses on two different time periods, and the book makes it easy to tell them apart. It is true that there were librarians that showed a LOT of courage during such a horrific time period- they helped soldiers and Jews during this time period through the power of books. Books were such a comfort to many subscribers and soldiers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t forget such The Holocaust, Jews were forbidden to go to certain places- like the library. So, we have these librarians who would deliver their books- despite the danger they were putting themselves in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these characters were real- if you read the very end, you will know who was real and who wasn’t. The ones who work at the American Library in Paris were doing everything they can to keep it open. A book about the power of literature, incredible friendship in the most unlikeliest of places, sacrifice, and explores the consequences of our actions. </p>\n",

Needless to say, I’m in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I so enjoyed this enemies to lovers romance about two egotistical fantastic NHL hockey players. The long time feud, fueled by misconceptions about each other, including one’s sexuality, is so well written.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bigger than life personalities of both D-man Ezra Palaszczuk and winger Anton Hayes, huge egos to match their vast athletic talents on the ice, it’s all there on the page for the reader to love, cackle at, and ,yes, swoon over, as they warily stumble their way into a relationship and romance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authors Finley and James are careful that, when crafting this novel , all the important elements are brought in so it feels believable and a world we should want to invest ourselves into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The games! The way the men fly across the ice, bodies moving, puck flashing, it’s pure awesomeness. It’s hockey! You can see these games and ,when or lose (they do both), you feel the emotional impact with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The men themselves are layered, their pasts, their passions, their pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ezra Palaszczuk is someone who appears one dimensional, on purpose, but only as a barrier to hide the damage done by negligent , borderline abusive parents and the toll it continues to take on him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anton Hayes has his own personal issues to work through and it’s his relationship with Ez that allows him the different perspective to start on a new path and journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This story has so many great aspects to it. It’s a dynamic hockey book. It’s a sexy romance. It’s a thoughtful conversation about gay athletes in a major sport (see fabulous The Queer Collective element), what it means for queer youth to have representation. It’s also about knowing yourself well enough that you’re finally comfortable and feel safe to come out .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said. There’s so much to Egotistical Puckboy (Puckboy #1) by Eden Finley and Saxon James. I love this. And I’m highly recommending it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a second story out. I’m onto that next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hockey season. Enjoy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Puckboy series:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Egotistical Puckboy #1</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Irresponsible Puckboy #2</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59623625\">https://www.goodreads.com › showEgotistical Puckboy – Goodreads</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Synopsis:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EZRA</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Partying, dudes, and hockey. What more could a gay NHL player want?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it weren’t for Anton Hayes, my life would be perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that he affects my life in any way. At all. That would imply I care what the winger from Philly thinks of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not even a one-night stand with him can thaw his misplaced animosity toward me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says I’m the one with the ego, but he can talk. He rivals me for most egotistical puck boy in the league.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate him as much as he hates me. Even if I crave a repeat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ANTON</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to hockey, I’m all about the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve worked for years to be one of the best in the league, and l’ve done it without splashing my orientation all over the tabloids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hockey image is one I’ve carefully cultivated, and after one night with Ezra Palaszczuk, I risk it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s cocky, obnoxious, and has an ego bigger than Massachusetts. And okay, maybe he’s the sexiest man I’ve ever known.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll never get along. Not when we sleep together. Not even when my possessive streak awakens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn’t stop us from falling into bed together over and over again.</p>\n",

        "content": "<p>For a story that was conceived during those long boring hours flying in a steel cocoon, striving to keep away the thoughts that the plane and everyone in it could just simply disappear as planes have in the past, it has come a long way.</p>\n<p>Whilst I have always had a fascination in what happened during the second world war, not the battles or fighting, but in the more obscure events that took place, I decided to pen my own little sidebar to what was a long and bitter war.</p>\n<p>And, so, it continues…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>It was clear, however, that Marina was familiar with the man and very annoyed with the woman.</em></p>\n<p><em>When I took a longer look at the man, I realised he was not a man at all, but a boy in his teens, blessed by the fact he looked older than he was.  My guess, about 16.  I was surprised he had not been conscripted into the war, there seemed very few young men in the area.</em></p>\n<p><em>Marina went straight over to him and snatched the elderly rifle he was holding away from him, the glared at Chiara</em></p>\n<p><em>“Are you stark staring mad.  Enrico is not supposed to be out in the open, hell, it’s been a battle to keep him hidden away.  What will his parents think when they discover he’s here?”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Pleased,” Enrico said.  “My father said it’s about time I did something to rid of the Germans, of the English too for that matter.  None of you has any right to be here.”</em></p>\n<p><em>Fervently spoken, and to the wrong person, it would earn him a bullet to the back of the head.  But I agreed with him.</em></p>\n<p><em>“All well and good,” Marina said to him, “but now there’s no easy way of doing that.  We must be careful, and you must stay put with your parents.  What we’re doing isn’t a game, you are neither trained or equipped to take anyone on, except perhaps rabbits.”</em></p>\n<p><em>Back at Chiara.  “Take him home, and never bring him back here.  You don’t want to be the one who has to tell his mother if he gets killed.  Now, both of you go now, before I shoot both of you myself.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“This is not the end of the matter,” Enrico said.</em></p>\n<p><em>“And when you’ve taken him back, come back here.  We need to talk.”</em></p>\n<p><em>Chiara said nothing, just nodded sullenly.  I think she believed the less said the better and did as she was asked, nodding her head in his direction, and adding a few choice phrases in Italian to him that I couldn’t understand.  It also just occurred to me that she had not asked Chiara the questions about the two men from the castle.  I guess that would have to wait until the safety of Enrico was settled, and she returned.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Make sure they’re safe,” she said to Carlo, and he disappeared, leaving us alone.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I thought all of the young men had been taken away by the Italian Army.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Not all.  We managed to hide a few away, but as you can see, despite our best efforts, they don’t seem to appreciate the trouble they could get into.  We used to have about a hundred young men from 14 through to 20 at the start of the war.  Two have found their way back, casualties of war, the rest, we may never see them again.  Enrico just doesn’t see the trouble he could get into.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“It’s called youthful enthusiasm.  In the first world war, joining up, or going to war, was a lark.  It was a little less so this time because most of the parents knew from firsthand experience what it was like and tried to shield them.  And if you didn’t join up, questions were asked, and quite often jail, except for some who landed cushy jobs away from the fighting.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“You were not so lucky?”</em></p>\n<p><em>“No, I was one of those mad buggers who thought joining up to fight would be an adventure.  That quickly faded when the enemy started shooting at me.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“And now you’re here, and a spy to boot.  That’s what they’ll hang on you if you get caught.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Then I shall try very hard not to get caught.  Again.”</em></p>\n<p><em> </em></p>\n<p><em>Chiara came back about an hour later.  It seemed to me it was a lot safer to move around at night with the blackout, and I doubted Thompson would spare any men from the castle to check up on the local farmers.</em></p>\n<p><em>And while I was at the castle, I didn’t hear anything raised about the local resistance, which I thought odd at the time, but now I knew why.  Most of them had joined him.  Better that than be hunted down and killed.</em></p>\n<p><em>Chiara still looked sullen.  A closer look showed she was not very old herself, barely out of her twenties, and surprising that the Italian army, or Thomson for that matter, had not rounded her up for ‘duties’ at the castle.</em></p>\n<p><em>There were a number of the local women working up at the castle, but they were mostly staff, or more likely forced labour, though I had thought we, when I believed it to be a British outpost, would be fairer to the locals than either the Germans or their own Italian military.  It’s odd how you tend to look at certain situations because of who you are, and the fact you would not do similar things at home.  The Germans, however, we would always treat differently, because they were the enemy, and because we expected the worst from them.  At that moment, though, wouldn’t the Germans think the same of us if the positions were reversed?</em></p>\n<p><em>Best not to think about that.  My view of the war and the people in it was clouded enough.</em></p>\n<p><em>Chiara, however, clearly thought the worst of me, and of those in the castle, and certainly didn’t think I was as neutral as I appeared.  A gun always in hand, I was sure she would shoot me again with the least provocation.</em></p>\n<p><em>We sat, both Chiara and Marina with their weapons on the table in front of them.  I wasn’t trusted enough to be given a weapon.</em></p>\n<p><em>Marina’s first question was directed at Chiara, “I’m told there were two men from the castle following Sam, and that he told you about them.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“He did.  We did not see them.  We didn’t take the path, because, as you know, it’s not safe.”</em></p>\n<p><em>It was a reasonable answer.  If the men at the castle were unfamiliar with the area, as I’m sure they would be, because they hadn’t been there for very long, and I doubt Thompson would want to advertise the nationality of those at the castle unless he had to, they would stick to the clearly-marked roads and paths.</em></p>\n<p><em>I had on my way to the castle, from a different direction.  It didn’t explain why I had not been met by the leader of the resistance as arranged, but that was now explained, both by the former leader trying to kill me in a roadside explosion, and then what I learned at the castle in the last few days.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Even so, there’s not that much distance between the two, and it is possible to shadow them.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I keep well away from them.  Perhaps Leonardo saw them.  He doesn’t have to worry about what they might do because they use him to supply food.  Maybe he knows more.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Perhaps I shall ask him next time I see him.  We need to know who from the castle is about and when so that we don’t get caught.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I’ll remember next time.  Is that all?”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Yes.”</em></p>\n<p><em>Chiara picked up her gun, gave me an extra-long sullen stare.  “I don’t trust this one, Marina.  You </em></p>\n<p><em>need to be careful.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“I will.”</em></p>\n<p><em>We waited a few minutes until after she had departed, and then Marina said, “We should be going too.  This place is a little eerie at night.  There are far too many ghosts for my liking.”</em></p>\n<p><em>I shuddered, then followed her out.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>© Charles Heath 2019</p>\n",

Andrzej Sapkowski.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shadow Gate</em> is book two in the <em>Crossroads</em> series by Kate Elliott. It is quite thought-provoking although at times not a very pleasant to read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand the much lauded <em><a href=\"https://thegreentealibrarian.wordpress.com/2021/02/18/review-the-house-in-the-cerulean-sea/\">The House in the Cerulean Sea</a></em> by TJ Klune is a cinnamon roll of a read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://thegreentealibrarian.wordpress.com/2018/10/09/review-the-wicked-deep/\">The Wicked Deep</a></em> by Shea Ernshaw is atmospheric and interesting if your fantasy tastes are leaning more spooky but not too scary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dragon Prince</em> by Melanie Rawn is the only book in this series that I’ve reread and I still love it. The second half does take on hard topics, including rape. Our characters are put through the wringer. It might be my favorite Melanie Rawn book (and this series is finished if you wanted to challenge yourself).</p>\n",

No, Hana! I can’t do this. I won’t!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I know,” she agreed quietly. “I know. I wanted you to touch me. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think maybe I should take you to your cabin,” he said awkwardly. His voice sounded tight and strained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yeah, nothing would kill the mood quite as fast as being reamed by Aunt Enid. Oh, if she could see me now!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She’d probably be less shocked than you think,” he grinned. “You did hear the story of how she met Ed, didn’t you?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yes, she invited him to take a bath with her in the pond.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Uh huh. And did she say anything else?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Nothing specific— Oh!” She remembered what Enid had said in passing. “<em>We didn’t exactly bathe</em>, that’s what she said. Oh!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jasper was chuckling. “Don’t ever tell your mother, she’d have a heart attack.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m sorry, I’m just—stunned. She was just about my age when they met.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He nodded, chuckling. “And your uncle was built like a Greek god, did she tell you that?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She said his butt was so tight, she could bounce a quarter off it.” Hana paused a moment, then took his hand. “Thank you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jasper sat beside her, holding her hands. “For what?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For making me stop and think,” she said quietly. “For making me realize that it’s you I’ve been waiting for all this time. I think Aunt Enid knew. I think she’s been trying to bring us together for a while, but the time was finally right.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Why now? Why not a year ago, or two years?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t know. I guess we’re both finally ready.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’d better take you home now,” he said, putting his arm around her waist. “Or I’m going to forget my own advice and start kissing you again.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It will happen when the time is right, Jasper.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He nodded, hugging her with one arm. “Let’s get you home. Your aunt’s going to burn a trail up and down my spine, if I keep you out too late.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They walked back to her cabin, holding hands, talking about inconsequential things. Just being together was enough, they didn’t even have to speak. Both fell silent when they reached the cabin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jasper embraced her, holding her close. Hana put her arms around his waist, hugging him tightly. He leaned over and gave her a chaste kiss on the cheek, intending to leave. Hana turned her head to meet his lips, daring him to pull away from her. There was a challenge in her that he couldn’t deny, and he let his lips fall on hers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I can stop. I can stop kissing her, turn and walk away. Anytime now. Anytime I want.</em> But he couldn’t. He felt himself falling into her, wrapping her around him like a warm, soft quilt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The porch light clicked on, startling them both. Hana wiped her lips with the back of her hand and ran fingers through her hair. Jasper shoved his hands in his pockets and backed away a step from her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Night, Hana. I’ll see you in the morning. We’ll plan our day at breakfast, okay?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’d like that,” she nodded. “Night, Jasper.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He kissed her hand, letting it go reluctantly. As he walked away, the door behind Hana opened slowly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I thought I heard voices out here,” Aunt Enid said with a sly grin. “Did Jasper leave?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yes, Auntie, he left. Subtle.” She chuckled and flicked the light switch. “Yet it made the point.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Oh? What point?” she tried to sound and look innocent, then lost control and started to laugh. “I’m sorry, Hana. It’s me being an old busy body. If the boy gets what he wants right off, then you haven’t got the fun of being pursued.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They walked back into the cabin together. Hana turned off the porch light and locked the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Did Uncle Ed pursue you?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He had to.” She chuckled as she remembered. “I ran off with his clothes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Is that what happened when he joined you in the pond? You ran off with his clothes?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enid’s eyes took on a dreamy, faraway look. “He was the best looking thing I’d ever seen. He’d been watching me most of the day, following me around and snapping pictures wherever I went. So when I went to bathe, I knew he’d be there and I lured him in. He wanted to fool around of course, but I wasn’t about to do that. Instead, I got him all lathered up with soap, ducked him under water and when he was trying to get the soap out of his eyes, I jumped out and grabbed his clothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I ran off with his things, and he had to follow me, butt ass naked until he caught up with me. I let him, of course. I could have outrun him, because I had a hell of a good head start. He stayed in the pond a while trying to decide what to do. Once he made up his mind, he caught up fairly quickly. It was funny as hell watching him run after me with his hands over his privates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“After he apologized for stalking me, I gave him his things back. We hung out the rest of the day, listened to the bands and enjoyed one another’s company. He didn’t try to touch me again, until I gave him permission, and that wasn’t until we’d been dating a while. A man needs to know his limitations, and it’s up to us to give them to him. I’ve often said the woman is stronger than the man. God made him a lustier being. Of course, if men weren’t so damn persistent, the human race would have died out a long time ago.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If they weren’t so damn gorgeous and sexy, then we wouldn’t fall all over our tongues and slip in the drool either.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>© Dellani Oakes 2022</p>\n",

I have created this map to assist in planning your perfect getaway. Grand Bend is surrounded by beautiful farmland, vineyards, and orchards. With this map you can create your own wine tour around the Grand Bend area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the wineries included are located close to beautiful Lake Huron allowing for an opportunity to visit the beach and the vineyards in the same trip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use this to map out your trip to the Grand Bend area with short country road travels between locations. All locations included provide a unique experience that is affordable. Shale Ridge offers the instagram experience, while Dark Horse provides a more classy and sophisticated environment. Grand Bend has a variety of options for a winery experience that ensures anyone can find what they are looking for. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy your wine experience in Grand Bend and and share your experiences in the comments! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Appendix:  <a href=\"https://shaleridgeestatewinery.com/pages/reservations\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://shaleridgeestatewinery.com/pages/reservations</a> <br><a href=\"https://darkhorseestatewinery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://darkhorseestatewinery.com/</a><br><a href=\"https://badapplebrewingco.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://badapplebrewingco.com/</a><br><a href=\"https://altonfarmsestatewinery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://altonfarmsestatewinery.com/</a><br><a href=\"https://bayfieldberryfarm.on.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bayfieldberryfarm.on.ca/</a><br><a href=\"http://wineathome.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wineathome.ca/</a><br><a href=\"https://hessenland.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hessenland.com/</a></p>\n",

It’s such a huge fort with lots of beautiful scriptures. It had a detailed history of the kings and queens. The Fort contained their swords, dresses, ornaments and other fighting equipments. From inside the Fort, one gets to view the “BLUE CITY” from above.

After resting for a few hours, we had our dinner in the Angithi Restaurant. Then, we went to sleep</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DAY 2After having our breakfast, we hired an auto and decided to visit different places at a fixed price. So after having a discussion with the driver, we went to our first destination, Umaid Bhavan Palace.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2151900156371731517/9152600951636843444#\"><img src=\"https://bishtriyaangles.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/bf7a4-img_3930.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The palace was converted into a hotel, so we were not allowed inside the hotel, but it had a museum so, we went there. The museum was based on the history of kings of the palace. There, we also got to see some vintage cars which were in display. They were really awesome!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2151900156371731517/9152600951636843444#\"><img src=\"https://bishtriyaangles.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/51e5b-img_3932.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Then after having lunch, we went to Balsamad Lake but couldn’t get to see it because the lake was inside a hotel and only the hotel guests could get to see it. Sad!Then, we went to Mandore Garden. It was a  really huge garden with temples, museum, lake and restaurants.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2151900156371731517/9152600951636843444#\"><img src=\"https://bishtriyaangles.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/08037-img_3953.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2151900156371731517/9152600951636843444#\"><img src=\"https://bishtriyaangles.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/57a51-img_3956.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Then we went to have or lunch from a traditional Jodhpuri restaurant. The food was really delicious.<br>After having our lunch, we went to the Machia Biological Park. It was basically a zoo. I got to see a variety of animals including Asiatic lion, cobra and many more!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2151900156371731517/9152600951636843444#\"><img src=\"https://bishtriyaangles.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/c9ef4-img_3993.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2151900156371731517/9152600951636843444#\"><img src=\"https://bishtriyaangles.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/1a698-img_3969.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2151900156371731517/9152600951636843444#\"><img src=\"https://bishtriyaangles.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/3dbb0-img_3984.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Later on, we went to Kaylani Lake. It was a vast lake and had motor boat rides. The wind was so swift and the view was mesmerising.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2151900156371731517/9152600951636843444#\"><img src=\"https://bishtriyaangles.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/94700-img_3994.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2151900156371731517/9152600951636843444#\"><img src=\"https://bishtriyaangles.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/53e26-img_4005.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>DAY 3After having a heavy breakfast, we took off to the local market and did some shopping. The market was really inexpensive. We bought clothes, artefacts, decoration items and sweets.<br>Then we had our lunch and went back to the hotel. We packed our stuff and went to the station for our train. Our train was scheduled at 7:45 pm to took off. We waited for some time and then boarded train. We reached Delhi at 7:30 am. We booked our cab and reached home.<br>So, this was all about my trip to Jodhpur. I hope you all will definitely visit Jodhpur if you haven’t yet!<br>Till then,<br>Take care,<br>Byee! </p>\n",

I’m gonna confess that I spent about 5 minutes trying to figure out how to start this post, but I figure I’m gonna get straight into it. As I write this, I’m sitting in Terminal C just around the corner from Gate 42, where I’m scheduled to fly to Washington DC-Dulles at noon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who are just tuning in, or don’t know me and Helen personally, this is the tl;dr for why this blog exists- We got accepted into the National Security Language Initiative for Youth program, Helen for Russian and me for Arabic, and we’re going to be blogging about our experiences for students back home who might be interested in studying abroad. We’ll try and keep up with this as best we can, but there may not be a regular post schedule and quite a bit of time may pass between posts, due to the nature of our programs. Anyway, back to the airport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my first time flying completely solo, and I’m honestly less apprehensive about it than I thought I’d be. There are some minor inconveniences, like not being able to just leave baggage with someone to go use the restroom or to go get a snack, but I’m liking the independence. I suppose I’ll have plenty of time to get tired of it over the next six weeks, if I ever do. The airport is completely packed, and the prices are somehow worse than I expected. It cost me 15 bucks for a sad slice of pizza and a tiny salad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m also feeling just a bit sad that I’m going to miss out on one last summer before college with my friends. Of course, I know that this is an opportunity of a lifetime, but it still aches a bit. I’m leaving on a jet plane, but at least I do know when I’ll be back again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that’s all tempered by the excitement I’m feeling. I’m pumped to finally meet my program cohort and to be back in Washington DC, and to finally visit the State Department! The next few days are going to be pretty insane, but I’m ready for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That just about wraps it up for now, I think. It’s time for me to get ready to board the flight to DC. Cheers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Well isn’t it the Eiffel Tower? I hope I guessed it right! Well France luckily is not only about the Eiffel Tower, cheese, wine and baguette, I am introducing you to this wonderland called as “Annecy”, and for all the right reasons it’s called as the Venice of the Alps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From narrow cobbled-stoned streets to the canal running through the lanes , it is no less than a paradise.  If you ask me, it definitely is my most favorite travel destination. If you are a mountain person and a lake person, then it would be your cherry on the cake. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mountains are covered with snow during winters and during summers, the skies dance in the shades of blue. It’s close proximity to Switzerland makes it one of the most beautiful regions to visit in France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are planning your trip to France, then this HAS to be added to your bucket list and trust me you won’t regret it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to get there : </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By air/ train</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Annecy is located 50 km from Geneva International Airport (Switzerland). There are direct train and bus/shuttle connections to Annecy from the airport.</li><li>Annecy is 125 km from Lyon Saint-Exupéry International Airport (France). There are train and coach connections to Annecy from the airport.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>By motorway</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Closest cities : Geneva (42 km) or Lyon (146 km)</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What to do </strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would suggest that a 3 nights and 4 days trip to Annecy is sufficient to explore the city and its surroundings. Here are some tips on what you can explore in Annecy: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Guided tours </strong>: There are a number of guided tours available in the tourism office. They will cost you around 6.50 Euros per adult. Children entry is free. </li><li><strong>Explore Old-Annecy </strong>– Enjoy walking in the lanes by yourself at your own pace, discovering the little cobbled-stone roads and local markets. </li><li><strong>Picnic</strong> in the garden near Lac’ Annecy. Immerse yourself in the goodness of fresh air and a fantastic view as you picnic in the gardens of the lake. A fabulous way to relax and de-stress yourself from the real world. </li><li>From <strong>pedal boat</strong> to <strong>water-skiing and wakeboarding</strong> you will find a number of activities that will keep you entertained. </li><li><strong>Chateau d’Annecy – </strong>You can add this to your do to list when you visit Annecy. A quick access from the old town, you can delve into history and enjoy some French culture.</li><li><strong>Geneva</strong> – Thanks to its close proximity to Switzerland, while you are enjoying your stay in Annecy, you can also plan your one day trip to Geneva, which is just about 40-45 minutes away by car and about 45 minutes – 1 hour by train. </li><li><strong>Chamonix (Mont Blanc)</strong> – Chamonix hosts the highest mountain in Western-Europe! YES, that’s right! This town is a winter wonderland and has cable car services from the city to Mont Blanc to explore breathtaking views! It takes you to <strong>The Aiguille du Midi</strong> and this cable car holds the world record for the highest vertical ascent: 2807m (from 1035m to 3842m). This is the closest you can get to the Mont Blanc on a lift system. It is approximately 1 hour away from Annecy by car. You can also explore other ways to get there by train or shuttle bus. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<figure data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":207955735,\"permalink\":\"https:\\/\\/shreyadailytravel.wordpress.com\\/2022\\/06\\/14\\/annecy-venise-of-the-alps\\/\"}'   class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-21 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"95\" data-permalink=\"https://shreyadailytravel.wordpress.com/2022/06/14/annecy-venise-of-the-alps/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"2094,3724\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.8","credit":"","camera":"iPhone 7","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1549019532","copyright":"","focal_length":"3.99","iso":"25","shutter_speed":"0.01","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485.jpeg?w=576\" data-id=\"95\"  src=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485.jpeg?w=576\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-95\" srcset=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485.jpeg?w=576 576w, https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485.jpeg?w=1152 1152w, https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485.jpeg?w=84 84w, https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485.jpeg?w=169 169w, https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/2a67ea4f-ec2f-44ce-a88d-41880eb36485.jpeg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" /><figcaption>Lanes of Annecy</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img data-attachment-id=\"100\" data-permalink=\"https://shreyadailytravel.wordpress.com/2022/06/14/annecy-venise-of-the-alps/d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3024,4032\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e.jpg?w=225\" data-large-file=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e.jpg?w=768\" data-id=\"100\"  src=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e.jpg?w=768\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-100\" srcset=\"https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e.jpg?w=768 768w, https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e.jpg?w=1536 1536w, https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e.jpg?w=113 113w, https://shreyadailytravel.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/d903077d-da6e-4e4a-894d-49cb9d26875e.jpg?w=225 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Lanes of Annecy</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Things to eat </strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Annecy has a number of little restaurants, sandwich shops, ice-cream parlors that you can indulge in! Here are some of my recommendations to you: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Raclette Sandwich</strong> – This definitely goes on the top of my list. Raclette is a type of Swiss-cheese you can find in the small sandwich shops in Annecy. You can order various types of sandwiches such as ham or only cheese. The sandwich is decorated with warm raclette cheese on top with the popular French baguette. </li><li><strong>Cheese board </strong>– You can order a cheese board in any restaurant and find number of different cheese on the platter such as reblochon, beaufort, abondance, chevrotin, raclette. A wonderful way to taste the region’s speciality. </li><li><strong>Ice-cream</strong> – I am definitely an ice-cream lover! One of the very famous ice cream shops in Annecy is the Glacier des Alps (opened in 1966). It has a variety of flavors that you can choose from.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you enjoyed my little guide to Annecy, France. This is my first ever written blog and I hope I keep delivering you more and more insightful content! And as the French say it </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A la prochaine ! </p>\n",

Inspired by vloggers with fishing content on YouTube, we figured it would be fun to do some camping and fishing. After watching a lot of YouTube videos, we were convinced that Kamandag beach is the best place to be. We are from Dasmarinas Cavite. It was near our place and they said camping and fishing were free. We prepared our camping and fishing gear and off we went. Excited. It was Saturday, May 7, 2022. We prepared for overnight camping and fishing. It was the first time in three years since we had our outdoor experience. We heard it was a nice place to be. And most of all it was free. Or so we thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"54\" data-permalink=\"https://orlyumali.wordpress.com/2022/06/11/kamandag-beach-adventure/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3.png\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3.png?w=1024\" src=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-54\" srcset=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3.png?w=1024 1024w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3.png?w=150 150w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3.png?w=300 300w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3.png?w=768 768w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-17h36m15s542-3.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We reached Ternate, Cavite, and were met by some barangay officials there. We were asked to pay the ecological fee. Twenty pesos each to be exact. It was minimal so it was okay. A certain Robert guided us to Kamandag beach. We paid him a hundred pesos for bringing us to the site. We were unaware that the beach is privately owned and when we got there, the property caretaker asked us to pay 100 pesos each as an entrance fee, 200 pesos for each tent that we brought, and 400 pesos for the bamboo table. We paid the entrance fee and the tent fee. We did not avail of the table. It was not free after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"56\" data-permalink=\"https://orlyumali.wordpress.com/2022/06/11/kamandag-beach-adventure/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859/\" data-orig-file=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859.png\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859.png?w=1024\" src=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-56\" srcset=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859.png?w=1024 1024w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859.png?w=150 150w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859.png?w=300 300w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859.png?w=768 768w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/vlcsnap-2022-06-11-18h32m51s859.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There were only two groups of campers when we arrived just before sunset. I must admit, the place is really nice. It has so many good points but it has its own minuses. Let’s talk about why this particular site is good.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"58\" data-permalink=\"https://orlyumali.wordpress.com/2022/06/11/kamandag-beach-adventure/kaman1-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/kaman1-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"kaman1-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/kaman1-1.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/kaman1-1.png?w=1024\" src=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/kaman1-1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-58\" srcset=\"https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/kaman1-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/kaman1-1.png?w=150 150w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/kaman1-1.png?w=300 300w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/kaman1-1.png?w=768 768w, https://orlyumali.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/kaman1-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Sunset at Kamandag Beach</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Good things about Kamandag Beach</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few people visit this area, especially on weekdays. If you really want to escape the business of urban living, this is one place where you will get to enjoy personal silence and music from the sea. You can practically do anything you want here without worrying that others will be disturbed. You Can Set up your bonfire and make quality time with relatives and friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The place is quite clean thanks to responsible campers and visitors. The view is great, especially the sunset. Fishing is great in the morning but you have to walk to reach a nice fishing spot near Puerto Azul. Trevallies, groupers, and checkered snappers are the common species you can catch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Kamandag beach you can also take a boat ride to other locations. Kayukno beach is a favorite. Carabao island in Maragondon is another. The ride will cost you from 250 pesos to 500 pesos depending on the number of destinations you want to visit. Generally, Kamandag beach is a budget destination. But it is not free.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Not so Good things about Kamandag Beach</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it is not a beach resort. So you will not find the comfort offered by a regular resort. There is no comfort room. No stores to buy food and drinks from. There is no shower room where you can take a bath after swimming on the shore. When you decide to go swimming, do not go barefoot. The stones are sharp and shells can give you cuts. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>My Recommendation</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Kamandag beach may not be free and does not offer the comfort you will find in beach resorts in the area but it is still a good place to go. The site is ideal for friends, groups, and families who want to enjoy a budget-friendly place near the sea. Just do not forget to bring your own tent, especially food and water. Camping and fishing are truly enjoyable here.</p>\n",

That is saying a lot, as I am also Type 1 Diabetic; as life would have it, I constantly have to be prepared for whatever might happen. The years I spent being a planner came in handy, and both my flight and check in for quarantine went more perfectly than I could have conjured. I spent two lonely weeks in a government quarantine facility, which was really just a posh hotel where I was served three meals a day, and transported for free via shuttle upon my dismissal. Thankfully I was not left to fend for myself after leaving quarantine. I had been planning for months to meet someone whom I consider my closest friend, and so I was so graciously provided with someone to rely on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose that means I did not travel entirely alone, but the majority of my time was spent trying to adapt to my new surroundings. There was a lot to process, and to be honest I am not sure I have yet to accomplish that task. I had planned for three months in Seoul, South Korea, but amid the tourist attractions, meeting a few friends and eating everything I could try.. my health was beginning to betray me. Surprisingly, my woes did not have much to do with Type 1 Diabetes, at first. Before departing for Korea, I was diagnosed with Diabetic Retinopathy, which is nerve damage to the eyes caused from T1D. My doctor assured me we had caught it early and I was still very capable of continuing on with my plans. Because of that, I had amazing experiences that I could never forget; as long as I write it all down. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid column1-desktop-grid__span-6 column1-desktop-grid__row-1 column2-desktop-grid__span-6 column2-desktop-grid__start-7 column2-desktop-grid__row-1 column1-tablet-grid__span-4 column1-tablet-grid__row-1 column2-tablet-grid__span-4 column2-tablet-grid__start-5 column2-tablet-grid__row-1 column1-mobile-grid__span-4 column1-mobile-grid__row-1 column2-mobile-grid__span-4 column2-mobile-grid__row-2\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid-column wp-block-jetpack-layout-grid__padding-none\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"445\" data-permalink=\"https://anonymousbluej.wordpress.com/2022/06/03/learning-to-fly/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049/\" data-orig-file=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1440,1795\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg?w=241\" data-large-file=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg?w=821\" src=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg?w=821\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-445\" srcset=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg?w=821 821w, https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg?w=120 120w, https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg?w=241 241w, https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg?w=768 768w, https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/b7dd2ce9-9382-45f2-a176-de7295c9a049.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px\" /></a><figcaption>Photo by S.

I wanted to believe it would go away on its own, and that it was the result of too much excitement; but I had a gnawing feeling that it was retinopathy-related. So, my friend and I made our way to the eye clinic where sure enough, I had started to bleed. This was shocking, as I had procedures before leaving the US which were meant to prevent the progression. As you can imagine I was confused, scared and a bit angry. I thought the effort I put in until that point had been wasted. But the doctors in South Korea patched me up with an injection and a warning that I would soon require further laser treatments or surgery to achieve a more permanent delay of the outcome. Later, however, I began to feel sickness in other ways. An issue arose with my wisdom teeth in which I was told I needed to remove them in order to prevent further problems. With this knowledge, I made the decision to have last-minute extraction in Korea. It was painless, and they were finished in five minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-rounded\"><a href=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"448\" data-permalink=\"https://anonymousbluej.wordpress.com/2022/06/03/learning-to-fly/img_6214-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1792,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"img_6214-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-448\" srcset=\"https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg?w=768 768w, https://anonymousbluej.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/img_6214-1.jpg 1792w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption>quarantine view</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-container-30 wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-column\">\n<p>This was not to be the end of my concerns, nor the most frightening thing I experienced while abroad. After the wisdom tooth extraction, I became dangerously ill. My tonsils were swollen so extremely that I could not breathe, I was dehydrated and my throat felt like I swallowed glass. At this point, we made the decision that I needed to be in an emergency room. This was a feat in and of itself, because with covid restrictions, no one had room or either they could not risk that what I was experiencing was covid. Finally, at 2 am in the morning a small hospital admitted me after I tested negative for covid. They gave me fluids and did their best to ensure I was in no danger of my airways closing, but they were afraid to keep me due to my T1D diagnosis. </p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-column\">\n<p>I went home, hoping I would be okay. Regretfully, I ended up at the ER again because I could not breathe, and my fever was persistent. I thought maybe the wisdom tooth issue had turned into a more serious infection. After several tests and a scan of my lungs and airways to ensure I was not septic or in danger of an abscess, the doctor at the second ER cleared me to fly. I had to make the heartbreaking choice to return home and treat this mysterious illness. I was later given instruction to visit a large university hospital for treatment, but in the end I knew I needed to return home. While preparing to leave, I was terrified I would not be able to fly due to fever and other symptoms. Somehow I made it through more than 20 hours of travel time, and was soon admitted to the ER in the United States.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>After miraculously making it home, and being admitted and tested in the ER, I was finally told that I had contracted a terrible case of a virus unrelated to covid 19. I spent several days in the hospital, and during this time I was left with my thoughts of being forced to return from my trip of a lifetime. I never quite recovered mentally from that aspect, and I knew even before the sickness and before returning home that I would depart for Korea once again in the near future. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>the journey will continue… </h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group alignfull\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-size:16px;line-height:1.8;\">A WordPress.com website.</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Mountain biking is like any other sport. You get what you pay. My experience with cycling has shown that the more money you spend, the better the equipment will be. There is a sweet spot. For a solid entry-level mountain bike, that’s between $600 to $700. The 4 best mountain bikes for under $750 in my opinion are the Marlin 5 from Trek at $569, the Talon 2 By Giant at $620, and the Cannondale 7 at $675. For $650, you can get the Specialized Rockhopper Sport for $650.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the price range of $600-$700 is my sweet spot. It’s still a mountain bike for less than $1,000, but it’s not the most affordable. This means that you get an entry-level bike with some upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we jump onto the bikes, let us discuss other factors that helped me reach this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WHY DO THESE BRANDS WORK?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many mountain bike brands, but these are the five most well-known brands in cycling. All of them offer high-end bikes at a competitive price. Trek, Giant, and Specialized offer bikes at very affordable prices with the highest quality components. All of these brands offer bikes at competitive prices, so you should ask which type of mountain biking trails you’ll use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WHAT KIND OF TRAILS WILL YOU BE USING?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to consider the type of trails that you will be riding on when choosing a mountain biking bike. Not all mountain bikes are equal. There are four main types of mountain bikes to choose from Cross Country, Trail, and Downhill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each mountain bike is made differently. Cross Country bikes are lighter, more efficient, and designed for climbing. Trail mountain bikes have suspension, tires, and brakes that can handle the downhill. Downhill bikes are built for tough terrain and the obstacles of any downhill section. The all-mountain/enduro bikes can climb but not as well as Cross Country and trail bikes. However, they excel at the downhill section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These bikes are all trail bikes. However, there are some cross-country bikes that are within this price range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE BETWEEN TRAIL AND CROSS COUNTRY BIKES?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people don’t know that there are many types of mountain bikes when they purchase their first mountain bike. We will be defining the two types that we are discussing in this article. Many of you know that I was unaware of the different types of mountain bikes until I started researching them to help me decide what one I wanted. This article will focus on trail and cross-country mountain bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people say “mountain bikes”, they think of trail bikes. This mountain bike is versatile and can be used on both trails and the roads. Trail bikes have better suspension than cross-country bikes, larger tires for better grip, and greater stopping power. These bikes are designed to be efficient but also allow for flat and downhill riding. A trail bike that is well-built will provide a smooth, efficient ride up. However, it doesn’t mean it will be easy. You will be able to handle steep corners and stop quickly with the brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-country bikes are designed with efficiency in mind. They are not designed to climb down mountains, but rather to climb them. Cross-country bikes can also handle downhill rides depending on their difficulty. They are not designed for downhill riding and have a weighted priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both cross-country and trail bikes are equally important in this industry. A bike that is capable of functioning at all levels is what I prefer. If I need a more specific bike, I’ll search for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we begin, let’s note that all these bikes come with tektro hydraulic braking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The 4 Best Mountain Bikes Under $700</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the list of <a href=\"https://o.bike/best-mountain-bikes-under-700/\">best mountain bikes under 700</a> dollars :-</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>TREK MARLIN 5</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"53\" data-permalink=\"https://obikeride.wordpress.com/2022/05/26/4-best-mountain-bikes-under-700/marlin5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/marlin5.webp\" data-orig-size=\"800,600\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"marlin5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/marlin5.webp?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/marlin5.webp?w=800\" src=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/marlin5.webp?w=800\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-53\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trek Marlin 5 mountain bike is very versatile. This bike comes with a Shimano drivetrain and is an amazing value. Some have complained that they needed to replace the tires and drivetrain after purchasing this bike. However, I believe the components included in the entry-level bike are capable of performing well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>GIANT TALON 2</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"51\" data-permalink=\"https://obikeride.wordpress.com/2022/05/26/4-best-mountain-bikes-under-700/giant-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/giant-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"867,650\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"giant-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/giant-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/giant-2.jpg?w=867\" src=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/giant-2.jpg?w=867\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-51\" srcset=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/giant-2.jpg 867w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/giant-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/giant-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/giant-2.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Talon 2 mountain bike is an amazing deal for beginners. This bike is beyond expectations. The Marlin 5’s main flaw is the Shimano parts used in the drivetrain. The Talon 2 retained the Shimano shifters but upgraded the cassettes as well as the derailleurs. This makes riding more enjoyable for riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/full-suspension-bikes/home\"><strong>Review of Top 5 Mountain Bikes Under 2000 USD</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>CANNONDALE 7</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"54\" data-permalink=\"https://obikeride.wordpress.com/2022/05/26/4-best-mountain-bikes-under-700/trail_7_/\" data-orig-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/trail_7_.png\" data-orig-size=\"2000,1138\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"trail_7_\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/trail_7_.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/trail_7_.png?w=1024\" src=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/trail_7_.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-54\" srcset=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/trail_7_.png?w=1024 1024w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/trail_7_.png?w=150 150w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/trail_7_.png?w=300 300w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/trail_7_.png?w=768 768w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/trail_7_.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cannondale 7 is one of the best deals on the list. Despite being a great deal, it’s also very much for beginners. This will allow you to take on light trails and jumps, but not with large obstacles or jumps without upgrading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ROCKHOPPER SPORT SPECIALIZED</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"55\" data-permalink=\"https://obikeride.wordpress.com/2022/05/26/4-best-mountain-bikes-under-700/rockhopper-sport-29/\" data-orig-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/rockhopper-sport-29.png\" data-orig-size=\"4000,2225\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"rockhopper-sport-29\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/rockhopper-sport-29.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/rockhopper-sport-29.png?w=1024\" src=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/rockhopper-sport-29.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-55\" srcset=\"https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/rockhopper-sport-29.png?w=1024 1024w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/rockhopper-sport-29.png?w=2048 2048w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/rockhopper-sport-29.png?w=150 150w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/rockhopper-sport-29.png?w=300 300w, https://obikeride.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/rockhopper-sport-29.png?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The specialized Rockhopper Sport is today’s final bike. This bike is the best on the list, except for its weight. Although the Rockhopper bikes were traditionally heavier for their purpose, Specialized may have made the bike lighter in 2021. Even though it’s a heavier bike, this bike is still one of our favorites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read:</strong><a href=\"https://obikeride.blogspot.com/2022/05/best-mountain-bike.html\"><strong> 5 Best Mountain Bikes under $1000 – Reviews 2022</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SUMMARY</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The top five bikes are capable and reliable. These bikes are great for beginners and intermediate mountain bikers. You might also want to consider the bigger brothers. There are more expensive models that are designed for serious riders. These bikes are a great choice if you’re concerned about price. You can also modify the bike as soon as you have the money.</p>\n",

It was located near the railway station, at a very accessible location. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">The hostel had such a unique twist. It was a hotel before, and they renovated it and gave it a modern touch, with quirky interiors and some fresh graffiti across the hostel. The graffiti walls across the place and the vibrant pieces of furniture complemented the chic and happening vibe of the area. The two-floor hostel had several dorms with 6 beds each and spacious private rooms with en-suite washrooms offering a 24*7 hot water facility. It also had the option of a female dorm, which I had booked. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:9px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-rounded\"><img data-attachment-id=\"41\" data-permalink=\"https://writershubcoin.wordpress.com/2022/05/19/review-of-a-hostel-stay-%ef%bf%bc/unnamed/\" data-orig-file=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1000,667\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"unnamed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed.jpg?w=1000\" src=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"Hostel\" class=\"wp-image-41\" srcset=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed.jpg 1000w, https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed.jpg?w=150 150w, https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed.jpg?w=300 300w, https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">I had arrived early, but the kind staff accommodated me before check-in time. There was a shared kitchen and a dining area. They also offered a complimentary high tea at 4 pm, where you could interact with other travellers. They had well maintained the hostel in terms of cleanliness and hygiene. Likewise, they gave me fresh linen and a blanket to use. There were facilities such as a common hangout area with board games, charging sockets and bedside lamps for each bed, air conditioning, free Wi-Fi, concierge, in-house dining, and many more services. Breakfast, towels, laundry services, and lockers were available for separate charges. There was a well-trained staff at reception and housekeeping for 24*7 service. The hostel also conducted fun activities such as karaoke nights, city tours, game nights, etc. I realized the best part about staying in these hostels is that they are super affordable compared to conventional hotels.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:9px;\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-rounded\"><img data-attachment-id=\"43\" data-permalink=\"https://writershubcoin.wordpress.com/2022/05/19/review-of-a-hostel-stay-%ef%bf%bc/unnamed-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1280,853\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"unnamed-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed-1.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"Hostel\" class=\"wp-image-43\" srcset=\"https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed-1.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed-1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed-1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed-1.jpg?w=768 768w, https://writershubcoin.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/unnamed-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color\">They are suitable for both business and leisure travel. The uniquely social nature of hostels will transform your trip. Zoho provides the best hospitality service by providing quality accommodation, great vibes, and the utmost focus on cleanliness, hygiene, and security of all their guests. A perfect spot for a relaxing and rejuvenating experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

I always though that Disney was just like every other themepark, just a themepark. But Disney is different. There is real Magic!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you can take a picture with Mickey Mouse. But that’s not all! There are shows with fantastic dancers, every attraction is in style and even the waiting lines are even decorated in style! I have to be honest; I wasn’t a really big fan of Disney before I went there. I even haven’t seen all the movies. Frozen is still on the watch list, oeps. Luckily my friends had seen all the movies and could also tell me which movie was which attraction and what the main story was. But I would recommend everyone, when and if you go, watch the movies! It was that my friends have seen them, but otherwise you miss a great part of the stories which are told. It’s not only the themed attractions, but also the shows where they are in. Like the firework show at the end of the day or the parade. Which I both highly recommend. Also a tip, a lot of people want to see those shows and (of course) want a good spot. If you want to be at the front row or at a specific spot, make sure that you are at that spot at least an hour before the show starts. Even then people will already be waiting. At least, that was when I was there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, there are some shows inside. You can make a reservation for those. And because there are limited places, it is logic to make a reservation (and pay for your spot). But here is the same as with the shows outside, if you are on time (like an hour), there will be a place for you and you don’t have to make a reservation and pay. I have to say that we went outside the children’s vacations and at weekdays. I can imagen that it will be busier in weekends and in vacations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shows were fantastic! We went to the Lion King show, with a lot of dancers, songs and acrobatic trics. We also have seen Mickey and the Magician. Which was also very nice. A lot of other Disney figures, like Belle and the Beast and Frozen appeared in the show. So that is also nice for little children (who have seen the movies J ). Especially because the language they speak in the show is French and Enligsh, it is a kind of mix, so little children from another country maybe can’t follow the speaking part. In the Lion King show are songs only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, a week back home, I miss the magic. But I am definitely going back some time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>X- Sophie</em>  </p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>15 May 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting in my office reading chair –– a floral wingback that didn’t quite have a place in my house –– I decide to continue the book I’m reading before resuming grading. Thankfully, I have acquired the skill of reading for pleasure despite a haunting to-do list staring at me from my desk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a couple of days we are leaving for our study abroad program, Global Leadership in Thailand, and a passage from Amartya Sen’s memoir <em>Home in the World</em> resonates. He talks about the history of Nalanda University in India, which held classes over 1500 years ago (before Oxford or Cambridge) and was an exemplar of global higher education. Some think Nalanda was primarily the result of trade along the Silk Road, but Sen offers this rebuttal:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If trade gets people together (and it certainly does), then so does the pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment. Mathematics, science, engineering, music and the arts, along with religious and ethical commitments, have prompted people to seek them across regions, by land and sea, over millennia. The motivation behind these journeys was not the pursuit of commercial gain, but the search for ideas – including, but not limited to, religious ideas. The huge modern popularity of seeing global connections through the prism of trade, of which the Silk Route is a leading example, should not be allowed to eclipse the fact that reflective engagements have motivated the movement of people across countries and regions for just as long. Globalization is the result not only of seeking business, but also of talking to – and learning from – each other.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that phrase “reflective engagements.” It summarizes my perspective nicely. This study abroad trip — and many of the global components of my career — are motivated and fueled by reflective engagement. Something happens in the mind and spirit when we joyfully engage with new ideas, people, and places. Our brains light up and our egos cool down. While COVID has seen a rise in digital engagement around the world (I have meetings in Southeast Asia weekly), I wonder at the impact of the pandemic on our collective ability to learn from the world around us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Onward.</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>I wish I could say I enjoyed my stay. Unfortunately, I didn’t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I was prepared that the place wouldn’t be as gah as it would have been before the pandemic, but I wasn’t prepared for what ensued. The only commendable thing about the whole experience was the staff. The communication skills were superb, but the service and the facilities/layout, whatever you call it, are slowly going down the drain. It would be pretty sad for all these young skilled staff to go just because the place is unable to serve as an exclusive abode for travellers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what could be improved? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Check-in ritual</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Taking into account that the lady could be new, I just feel that there is certain information that must be conveyed automatically to the guest. Which should be included as part of the training if you are to man the check-in counter. Such as the WIFI password, breakfast time, breakfast area and highlights of the hotel such as access to the garden park, pool, and directions to the kids club room. I felt that the lady failed to recognize that I actually booked extra service from the hotel which included the birthday room decor and kids package. It would be helpful to advise guests early regarding payment and such activities. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The rooms</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">My room is on the ground floor because I chose the garden view. Plus point is that it is near the breakfast cafe. The minus points are that you will be walking through the hallway that has public toilets. If they are cleaned regularly, they will not smell. Otherwise, merasalah kau bau hancing sepanjang jalan menapak ke bilik. You could also feel this damp, musty feeling as you walk through the hallway and also as I entered our room. Macam bilik yang tak pernah dapat cahaya matahari sort of thing. Lembap semacam. It is honestly very uncomfortable. The room lighting is also so malap with the switches macam haywire. Like, OMG.. <em>porque? porque?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Not only that, my room is directly beside an open hall area where activities are held. So, be prepared to have people standing outside your hotel room door during the day. It’s like dah kenapa ko bersidai tepi pintu aku. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I was also very disappointed with the gifts that my kids get from the extra room package thing. I mean, how is a puzzle that has a tank at a dataran picture spells out cute for kids? Even if you give a standard, white embroidered towel with cute animals or flowers, the type that they can bring to the pool  pun budak akan suka. <strong>But puzzle? Who’s great idea is that? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Thankfully, the birthday room decor was <strong>ACCEPTABLE </strong>although I was like, why is the Happy Birthday balloon decor in black? What happened to happier colours? I would suggest the fruits to be cut up though. Guest bukannya bawak pisau nak potong epal, oren bagai untuk kongsi dengan semua. Please don’t say something like, boleh gigit kan epal tu.. haih.. hempuk jugak lah. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"11283\" data-permalink=\"http://mincimoss.com/wp-1652620271628/\" data-orig-file=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2880,2880\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"wp-1652620271628\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11283\" srcset=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg?w=150 150w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg?w=300 300w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620271628.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption>Husband’s 37th birthday – yep, he is younger than me</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Housekeeping</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">As of most 4 or 5 star hotels, you wouldn’t see a water dispenser anywhere. Hence, you would depend on the complimentary mineral water and kettle in the room for drinks. Can you imagine the horror when you realize that in the room tetiba <strong>no remote control for the TV, no kettle and there is only ONE cup to drink</strong> your hot beverage. Itu pun, bila tengok supplies tu macam, kau ikhlas ke nak terima aku as guest ni? Seriouslah.. I have never been so pissed. So we called room services and had these problems sorted out. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"11287\" data-permalink=\"http://mincimoss.com/wp-1652620698993/\" data-orig-file=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3456,4624\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.8","credit":"","camera":"SM-A325F","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1652561175","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.6","iso":"3200","shutter_speed":"0.11111111111111","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"wp-1652620698993\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg?w=224\" data-large-file=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg?w=765\" src=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg?w=765\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11287\" srcset=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg?w=765 765w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg?w=1530 1530w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg?w=112 112w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg?w=224 224w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620698993.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px\" /></a><figcaption>sedihnya housekeeping macam ni</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Room service</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">Room service is supposed to be convenient. People order room service because they do not want the hassle to leave the room to eat. They are willing to pay extra just so they could attend to their matters in the room while having a nice, hot meal. This hotel does not have the usual hard copy menu in the room. Instead, we have to scan a QR code. Only, they did not tell where the QR code is. Jenuhlah aku mencari dlm laci, at the check in card and all for this QR code. Only later did they say they will send the QR code to the room and to call 0 to place an order. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Might as well you give me the physical menu and take my order at the door, kan? Tapi takpe.. I will take that QR code, call O and place the order before 930pm. Now, a wait of 30 to 40 mins to me is acceptable but to wait for nearly an hour – is just ridiculous. Lebih me-ridiculouskan is that the staff said they are still busy with the buffet. Well lady, I don’t give a shit. I have kids who is having trouble to stay awake but hungry at the same time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">The food finally came. My initial order was a set of chicken briyani, honey bbq club sandwich, tomato arabiatta from the kids menu, 2 cans of Sprite and 2 additional bottled mineral water. They did not provide me with the mineral water, reason being, there’s already water in the room (masalahnya aku nak extra, and I am paying for it, part mana yg tak faham tu?) My problem with the meal was the spaghetti. They should put a chilli picture next to the menu to indicate the level of spiciness. Since it was under the kids menu, mestilah kita tak expect it wouldn’t be THAT spicy kan? Well no, it was damn spicy. Thankfully, the briyani saved the day. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">This hotel has a really nice location. The garden park is wonderful. Cuma tuhlah. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"11284\" data-permalink=\"http://mincimoss.com/wp-1652620336195/\" data-orig-file=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2880,2880\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"wp-1652620336195\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11284\" srcset=\"https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg?w=150 150w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg?w=300 300w, https://mincisensei.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/wp-1652620336195.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I can imagine it’s majestic reputation at one point in time. I believe it could be what it was once again with time and a bit of improvement to the facility and service. You’ve already got the people. Until it buckles up, I have to say, it is not an option for my hotel stay in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">We checked in at 8pm, after hadap terrible traffic on the highway for hours, and I had imagined a night where everything is in place. I imagined a night where I could take my hot shower, hair in a turban, sipping hot coffee at the desk while eating my hot meal and watching TV. I’d imagined the kids be sleeping restfully after the meal while my husband and I have a chat. But no, it did not happen. Room service was so lambat that the kids were already asleep. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">ntah berapa kali aku angkat tepon, call for this, call for that.. haih.. stress sangat. I am not paying for 280 per night taw. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>I am paying RM360/night with an additional RM120 for decor (&cake) and RM125 for room service meals.</strong> Can you sense the disappointment?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">In short, don’t waste your money here until you read a better review this year.   </p>\n",

By upgrading the system with Samsung’s SoC-based displays, the Dubai Airport team can now use their new VisionAir FIDS software without external PCs – a consolidated approach that is already reducing both the electrical footprint and airport operating costs.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the project, Michael Ibbitson, Executive Vice President of Technology and Infrastructure at Dubai Airports, said: “As the world’s busiest international airport operating near capacity, we understand that the the most effective way to respond to growth without physically expanding infrastructure is by deploying smart technologies and improving processes.  Information and communication are essential parts of airport operations and we are confident that this new display system will go a long way in helping us deliver a smooth and consistent experience to the millions of customers who pass through our airports each year.</p>\n<p>Seog-gi Kim, Executive Vice President of Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics, added, “By providing a single, dedicated platform for cloud-based content management, the FIDS solution improves customer service with fast, effective and visually impactful information.  We are delighted to partner with Dubai Airports and look forward to demonstrating how our Smart Signage displays and VisionAir FIDS solution can revolutionize communications and productivity within the transport industry.</p>\n<p>Some of the new system’s advanced features include the ability to run it from an Internet browser without the need to install local software.  It allows activating screen layouts and content for specific areas of the airport from a mobile device or from the control room.  The system enables collaborative content management, giving airlines, ground handling agents or other airport service partners a certain level of control in managing different types of content such as branding, passenger advice , as well as operational messaging, flight information and advertising.  The system can also help reduce power consumption through backlight control.</p>\n<p>Bogdan Stănescu, CTO, AirportLabs said: “When we built VisionAir, we saw it as a key part of the next generation travel experience and so we are really excited to work with such a forward-thinking organization. than Dubai airports to bring us closer to this vision.  We are confident that our system paired with Samsung SoC-based displays will greatly contribute to the operational efficiency of the airport while ensuring their passengers have a consistent and rewarding experience.</p>\n<p>As part of the project, a total of 2,700 display screens were also replaced in Terminal 3, Concourses A, B and C.</p>\n</p>\n</div>\n<p>By: asia travel blog.

While browsing the cookie aisle, it felt like the Pan di Stelle had read my mind and was exclaiming “pick me!” from the shelf. That’s when I decided it is time to welcome Pan di Stelle into my snack stash. Little did I realize that this seemingly humble chocolate cookie is actually a beloved <em>stella </em>(star) in its home country, Italy! Slipping into my sleuthing boots, I took a step into the Italian sweet tooth realm to learn more about my snack stash’s new member.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ciao, Pan di Stelle!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pan di Stelle is made by a cookie brand called <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.barillagroup.com/en/brands/mulino-bianco/\" target=\"_blank\">Mulino Bianco</a>, which is owned by Barilla (yes, the pasta people). It turns out that this treat isn’t any ordinary dessert-like cookie… it was created with the idea of being a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.archiviostoricobarilla.com/en/explore/focus/company-history/pan-di-stelle-2/\" target=\"_blank\">breakfast cookie</a>! Peeking into Italy’s breakfast world, a brekkie consisting of coffee and cookies is indeed a common option. Pan di Stelle has been delighting Italian chocoholics for a few decades, and it has become an icon in Italian supermarkets’ cookie sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pan di Stelle’s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.pandistelle.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Italian website</a> is what chocolate dreams are made of, digitally. DIYs of upcycling their products’ packaging, printable crafts and recipe ideas are some of the fun finds online. This is also where I discovered that the cookie has its own spinoffs: from gelato to various boxed chocolate cakes and breakfast cereal. And there’s even a Pan di Stelle chocolate spread, which made a buzz in the foodie universe when it was first introduced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I’ve got to mention that their Christmas <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtmE5TuXTuU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">adverts</a> are adorable!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the realm of homemade desserts, Pan di Stelle cakes (or <em>torta Pan di Stelle</em>) are popular. The cookies themselves are transformed into decadent starry chocolate eats. Many of the recipes I found include cheeses such as marscapone and ricotta for Pan di Stelle cheesecakes and tiramisu. Some add Nutella to their cakes too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Cookie Reveal</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"16061\" data-permalink=\"http://thejourneyndestination.com/2022/05/15/italian-chocolate-and-iced-sugar-star-cookies-pan-di-stelle/20220511_104527/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_104527.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"4032,1816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"20220511_104527\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_104527.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_104527.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_104527.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16061\" srcset=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_104527.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_104527.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_104527.jpg?w=150 150w, https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_104527.jpg?w=300 300w, https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_104527.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With a similar anticipation that Cookie Monster has before feasting on cookies, I eagerly opened my cookie pack.

To my taste buds, the cookie had a slight reminiscence to one of my favorite <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://thejourneyndestination.com/2020/05/07/ultimate-milk-chocolate-and-white-chocolate-breakfast-cereal/\" target=\"_blank\">chocolate breakfast cereals</a>. The fabulous taste and quality of the cocoa, which is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.barillagroup.com/en/brands/pan-di-stelle/\" target=\"_blank\">sourced</a> from a chocolate producer called Barry Callebaut, shined instantly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could imagine sitting on a balcony overlooking beautiful views of Rome or along the Amalfi Coast on a sunny morning, sipping on a cappuccino (which is commonly seen as a ‘breakfast coffee’ in Italy) and having a bite of this cookie. After all, when in Rome (or as close to Rome as you can get), do as the Romans do.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"16066\" data-permalink=\"http://thejourneyndestination.com/2022/05/15/italian-chocolate-and-iced-sugar-star-cookies-pan-di-stelle/20220511_155752/\" data-orig-file=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_155752.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3349,1642\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"20220511_155752\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_155752.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_155752.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_155752.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16066\" srcset=\"https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_155752.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_155752.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_155752.jpg?w=150 150w, https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_155752.jpg?w=300 300w, https://thejourneyndestination.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220511_155752.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>By my third bite, my taste buds registered the Pan di Stelle more as a cookie rather than breakfast cereal, but there is a different depth in flavor in comparison to regular chocolate cookies. I feel it might be credited to the butter, as butter is a primary ingredient that is featured alongside cocoa on the package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iced sugar stars on top are lovely too.

It needed moneymen from the great capital centers of Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.</p>\n<p>Of the three, Boston was the most railroad minded. It had been the nation’s first major hub, with any number of lines running in and out of the city. For a small city on a stub of a peninsula, Boston was surprisingly worldly. The first great Boston fortunes were made in the China trade, then amplified by investments in the textile mills of early industrialization, only to be compounded by provident marriages to the daughters of other wealthy Bostonians. The investors were referred to as the Boston Crowd because of this interbreeding. They were mostly drawn from that class of Bostonians—Brahmins was the derisive term—whose members were, in the main, Harvard-educated Episcopalians, with the occasional Unitarian thrown in, who lived for their clubs and thought of themselves as existing on a social plane only slightly down from God. They were like honeybees in a hive—industrious but interchangeable.</p>\n<p>From this esteemed collective about the only one to emerge with a distinctive personality was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Jefferson_Coolidge\">Thomas Jefferson Coolidge</a>—and he on the strength of a surprisingly frolicsome memoir he had privately printed, the copies limited to just forty-eight—who served as the Santa Fe president for a year starting in 1880. Coolidge took his middle name from the American president, his great-grandfather on his mother’s side, but his lineage could be traced back to a Coolidge who settled in Watertown, just downriver from Boston proper, in 1630.</p>\n<p>Coolidge grew up in Canton, China, where his father was a partner in a Boston trading firm that dealt tea and opium in the China Trade. After Harvard, he married the daughter of William Appleton, clipper ship owner, European trader, president of Boston’s Second National Bank, congressman, president of the Massachusetts Hospital, and one of the richest men in the city.</p>\n<p>Coolidge served as the ambassador to France, and on any number of important national commissions, but he prized above all else his membership in The Friday Club, which, he noted, had once blackballed the eminent Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, father of the Supreme Court Justice, for fear he would dominate the conversation. His memoir is rich in frivolity—meeting the actress Fanny Kemble at a monastery in the Alps, touring the Caribbean aboard his eighty-foot yacht, riding a donkey to the temple of Ramses in Egypt.</p>\n<p>In recounting his life, Coolidge mentioned his yearlong presidency of the Santa Fe railroad only in passing. In October of 1878, he wrote, he took his son and namesake for an extensive tour of the West that covered almost ten thousand miles, particularly enjoying the Colorado portion aboard the Santa Fe Railroad with one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Barstow_Strong\">William Barstow Strong</a>. Coolidge did not mention that he was a director of the company at the time. When he returned to the West two years later, he noted that he again boarded a Santa Fe train, but this time stepped off at Topeka, where “I was elected president of the Atchison Railroad at the annual meeting.”</p>\n<p>Six sentences later, he was done with it. “I resigned as soon as I could,” he wrote. “I think in about a year and a half.” He failed to mention that on assuming the presidency, he had purchased $700,000 worth of the company. The point being, he presided over the Santa Fe only as an investor. The moment the investment seemed unpromising, he sold it and got out.</p>\n<p>None of the Boston Crowd served as presidents for more than a few years. But this was the way of the modern corporation as they came to define it. They were not managers, but investors, and that inclined them toward caution in a business that demanded daring.</p></blockquote>\n",

Or felt its bumps at the edge of a pedestrian road crossing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it made me think what are the tactile pavings, the boundaries or warning signs, in the rest of our lives that tell us stop or change direction? Not always because danger lies ahead but at least to tell us that this step is not for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a great believer in gut instinct. How do I feel when I make a decision, whether it seems straightforward or troublesome? Is there a sense heaviness or lightness? I think sometimes that lightness can be part of God’s peace about a choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, a sense of increasing stress or dread can be a warning sign that this isn’t the way forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gut feeling can be a good indication but it’s wise to look for other</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember reading about nautical navigation: lining up three lights in order to journey safely into harbour, avoiding hidden rocks. The article talked about lining up God’s three lights to aid decision making: circumstances (nudging a door that appears to be opening), wisdom from godly friends (who can bring the objectivity we may lack), and what God’s Word says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If one of these lights is out of alignment, we need to pause. Perhaps it’s a case of not yet, wait for things to fall into place. Or perhaps it’s one of those boundary warnings, leading us down a different fork in the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These signals, like the tactile paving under our feet, can seem uncomfortable, unpleasant even. We all prefer God to guide us by clearly saying: “This is the way – walk in it” (1) to His alternative strategy of saying “No, not this way,” We’d rather be Joshua, following God’s map into the Promised Land, than Jonah, directed off the wrong path by storms and sea monsters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But God has a far bigger perspective than us of what lies ahead, what will be to our best benefit, and how we can best benefit His world. And we know that His plans for us are for our good, “to prosper [us] and not to harm [us], to give [us] a hope and a future.” (2)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s pay attention when we feel those disagreeable bumps under our feet, pause, and ask: “Which way?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(1) Isaiah 30. 21</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(2) Jeremiah 29.11</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Every week the Five Minute Friday community free write for a limited time inspired by a given prompt word.

        "content": "\n<p>Sometimes I forget that Tena is actually a city surrounded by nature…rainforest nature. A mere 2.6 km outside Tena is this beautiful resort tucked away in the forest. We first heard about <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/hotel/ec/arahuana-jungle-resort-amp-spa.en-gb.html?aid=318615;label=English_Ecuador_EN_EC_29380108705-dzQgooGnP3k_VTuH7mTebAS217271355749%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atidsa-64415224945%3Alp9069568%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm;sid=3f07df1692ba4d6efd2159b525341c91;dest_id=-934322;dest_type=city;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=1;hpos=1;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;srepoch=1652566033;srpvid=89cd9b876355000f;type=total;ucfs=1&\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Arahuana</a> from Shane’s work colleague, who described this magical <em>Resort del Dia</em> (resort for the day) package. So, a few weeks ago, when Shane had a day off, we decided to switch up the routine and check it out!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://turismoaccesible.ec/site/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ARAHUANA-RESORT_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption>Photo from <a href=\"https://turismoaccesible.ec\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://turismoaccesible.ec</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">A quick side note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I said “a few weeks ago, when Shane had a day off work,” I meant that in the literal sense. As of this post, he’s on day 17 in a row. I recently posted about our <a href=\"https://theshwits.com/2022/04/01/tena-ecuador-six-month-impressions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">six-month impressions of Ecuador</a>. What I didn’t include in that post was our six-month impressions of the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">In short, it’s relentless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I can speak for Shane when I say that the project is great, and he genuinely enjoys what he does on a day-to-day basis. However, the problem is two-fold. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It’s a lot of ‘effin work to take care of 100+ caterpillars, a plant house to feed those caterpillars, and 15+ cages of butterflies. Every. Single. Day. </li><li>His experimental design takes about ~2 weeks for one round of data collection.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For some context, it takes 1 to 2 hours to feed the butterflies and anywhere from 4-6 hours to feed the caterpillars. Shane and Lucie should also be running experiments somewhere in there, given that’s the whole reason we’re here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve hired research assistants and have recruited student interns, but at the end of the day, it’s still just a lot of work that can’t be neglected. Unhealthy caterpillars mean no butterflies, which means no data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, my least favorite part about living in Ecuador has nothing to do with Ecuador itself; it’s Shane’s work schedule! Honestly, I expected him to be busy, but I did not expect the lack of routine days off. But, with time, I (we) have come to accept this new reality. I, especially, needed to shift my expectations so I wasn’t aNoYEddd 😤 all the time. And luckily, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://theshwits.com/2022/02/13/butterfly-collecting-101/\" target=\"_blank\">I’m a field biologist now</a>, so I can come and help when he needs or wants it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I share this because I think being honest about living and working abroad is important. It can look dreamy from afar, but there are downsides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also share this to emphasize how EXCITINGGGG it was to go relax at a resort for the day!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Ok, so back to this magical place in Tena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Resort del Dia</em> package is $25 per person for 3 or more people (or $30 pp for 2). It includes access from 10 am to 4 pm to the entire property, which has beautiful paths throughout, an observation tower, and a spa (for an extra cost). Most importantly, they have two pools… and let’s be real.

        "content": "\n<p>It’s so long since I’ve been away so long that I forgot what it was like – reverse culture shock. Being back in Bristol is at turns an enjoyable daydream and a slow dislocation from my surroundings. I sit at pubs and in parks with faces and bodies that for months I met only across a fuzzy screen – now they coalesce into spirits lit by colour and live in stereo sound. And the next day, I’m the one behind glass: dancing at a party when suddenly the set changes and I feel the strangeness of the people here, who are all exotically tall and pale and look just like me. I follow my internal StreetView in a foreign city. As I round the corners I’ve travelled by for 5 years I think, <em>I think I’ve been here before</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of good parts to reverse culture shock. First, everything is so easy. I slip into twists of language I could never manage in Guatemala, rejoicing in curls of the tongue and turns of the truth. I can make people laugh more easily, I am sharper, I am got and I get straight to the point. I’ve never been so charming! I’ve also never been so fast. I can dart about town on my bike while dodging only the occasional pothole. I travel from London to Bristol, a distance of slightly over 100 miles, in under two hours. A road built straight in Guatemala leads only to the sea. I think of travelling to and from Antigua, of highways that spooled across the volcanoes and valleys. Here is quick, straightforward, convenient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s the inconvenience of Guatemala that makes it at once so charming and so maddening. Listen to the frustrated car horns and see the clashes of the <em>camionetas. </em>The force of sound and colour press in upon you. Here in south-west England, the spring is rising and the trees flower on the hills. It’s the perfect time to come back, the romancing season with the oak corsages and the cherry garlands. Things are quietly lovely – but I think longingly of the bombastic bottle-brush tree that graced my yard in Antigua. Over there I was exotic like that tree is to me. And it’s self-indulgent to say that, but there is a part of me that liked standing out, that liked being acknowledged as an outsider or interloper, and people would ask me curiously where I was from, because they guessed that I was from elsewhere and had myself come with curiosity to their country. <em>¿De donde eres? </em>I was asked every day, and it is a privilege to be asked that question with interest and openness. I also miss the answer. Not speaking Spanish every day feels strange and unnatural, like a secret I’m sharing only with myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of all the shock manifests as longing: I feel homesick now I’m home. I imagine the feeling will fade over the summer, as I sink back into the roles and routines of life in Bristol. Knowing that now and then a memory of the other home will resurface unexpectedly, or I’ll be brought up sharply to the feeling of not being fully here. But I have a trick. At any point I can recall my second home, by closing my eyes and travelling the roads around Fuego in my head. In there, there’s no StreetView; but the mind map is quick and vivid.</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Day 1 in Detroit, Michigan and crossing the Canadian-US Border (5/7/22):<br>-I got absolutely grilled by my own people crossing the land border from Windsor to Detroit. I think I was asked close to twenty questions from what were the breeds of the dogs I rescued to what form of payment I used to book my flight tomorrow to South Africa. I’m pretty sure it would’ve continued had I not been saved by the border patrol having a shift change.<br>-Mexicantown is where it’s at.<br>-I drove up all of 8 Mile and it wasn’t as bad as I expected. Every street just had cannabis shops, strip clubs, and pawn shops like any other lower-class area.<br>-I went to Eminem’s 8 Mile trailer park and it wasn’t as bad as I thought it’d be either. It was just a normal trailer park.<br>-Detroit has the worst potholes I’ve ever seen and they are everywhere.<br>-I went to TV’s Hardcore Pawn and it wasn’t anything mind-blowing either, just like any other pawn shop.<br>-The Belt and Joe Louis’ “The Fist” are definitely worth visiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Day 2 in Detroit, Michigan (5/7/21):<br>-Eastern Market is everything. Just food on food on food. From gumbo to draft kombucha to craft beer.<br>-I stayed in an Airbnb that was a fixer-upper house. Ended up being the worst idea I’ve ever had. No security, ran like a self-check-in hostel, horrible neighborhood advertised as “non-gentrified”, and not cleaned sufficiently. When I gave him a 3-star review for the aforementioned issues he replied, cussing me out and insulting me. Saying I was cheap and exaggerating like a true professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summary: Detroit is somewhere I just couldn’t live. Too cold, not enough to do, too many unsafe areas such as 7 Mile, and you don’t get enough bang for your buck. Not bad to visit for a day or two, but just not my style.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

In the good old days of not knowing everyone’s E-mail address, we relied on snail mail to make the initial contact and let her know when we were coming and asking if we could get together. As the day of our departure drew closer and closer, we still had not heard from her and we grew worried we would miss meeting up with her, altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At long last, I received an E-mail from Kunika, reading “Kunika is Alive”. The only mailing address we had was for her parents, who had moved not long ago. The letter had been held up, but was finally delivered. The parents let Kunika (now married and living elsewhere) know she had mail and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had arranged to meet at our hotel on this day to head off an adventure in Kamakura (separate posts) and then join Kunika and Masa for supper, back at their home. Masa was in the dentist chair in the morning, but would join us in Kamakura later in the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"754\"

        "content": "\n<p>Closing out the East Liberty portion of the Then & Now 10-year anniversary series is the Penn Ave Bridge Ramp. This ramp inspired the second Pittsburgh edition of <a href=\"https://urbantraipsing.com/2012/07/27/what-is-a-bridge-part-ii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What is a Bridge?</a>. As best as I can make out from the data on the <a href=\"https://infobridge.fhwa.dot.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">National Bridge Inventory</a>, the Federal Highway Commission does not consider the ramp a bridge. It is not marked as one of the bridges inventoried by the Commission. And the data for the Penn Avenue Bridge does not include any approach spans. This leaves me wondering who, if anyone, inspects the ramp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I cannot find a public source that shares inspection data of the ramp (if it is inspected), its condition rating is anyone’s guess. However, this lack of data may be attributable to the change the ramp underwent in the last ten years. It was originally a ramp for buses to travel from a major bus stop off Penn Avenue onto the East Busway. With the redevelopment of the East Busway Station, this bus stop was redesigned as a regular on-street stop and the ramp was converted to pedestrian access only (second photo set below). The National Bridge Inventory seems to skip over pedestrian bridges as the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://urbantraipsing.com/2022/02/15/then-now-east-liberty-pedestrian-bridge/\" target=\"_blank\">East Liberty Pedestrian Bridge</a> featured in February is also not listed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the ramp’s condition, its fate now seems tied to the fate of the Penn Avenue Bridge as the gap between the two been filled in with much needed greenspace (first photo set below). The Penn Avenue Bridge was last inspected in May 2020 (which means it probably has been or will be inspected again this month). It received a “poor” condition rating in that inspection – a rating that is worrying for Pittsburghers since the collapse of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://urbantraipsing.com/2022/01/29/poor-condition-forbes-ave-bridge-collapsed-yesterday/\" target=\"_blank\">“poor” condition Fern Hollow Bridge</a>, despite reassurances from the bridge engineering community that “poor” condition does not necessarily equate to imminent danger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<figure

The city government did a lot to clean up the waterfall and the surrounding area but the water still stank and the catch basin was frothy and covered in white soap suds probably from a combination of laundry and sewage waste water. Some friends who saw these photos say Hinulugang Taktak and its surrounding area are much cleaner now. There are also plans for a waste water treatment plant here. But we can’t help but think that perhaps the city government should also focus on educational campaigns and public awareness on water pollution.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jpleo/43406245981/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/925/43406245981_aa2dc5901b_c.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><figcaption><span style=\"font-size:small;\"><b>Hinulugang Taktak back in 2017.

This wasn’t too difficult for Leo but the walk back up meant he had to stop every so often to catch his breath. He’s still ways off from doing longer cross-country treks that we are planning after he completes his rehab but this was at least a good exercise. There’s an elevator here that would have made this unnecessary but the operator wasn’t around. It was still an enjoyable experience nonetheless.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"8502\" data-permalink=\"https://shoestringdiary.wordpress.com/hinulugang_taktak2022-04shoestring/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/hinulugang_taktak2022-04shoestring.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,533\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1651829898","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"Hinulugang_Taktak2022-04Shoestring\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>\nThe sun’s position meant we had to shoot against it if we positioned ourselves directly in front of Hinulugang Taktak.

Even before the pandemic, Tipulo features open-air dining. It’s actually a covered facility open on three sides. Plenty of vegetation around the place gave it a cozy feel and somewhat mitigated the scorching heat on this day.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"8505\" data-permalink=\"https://shoestringdiary.wordpress.com/tipulo-dishes-shoestring/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/tipulo-dishes-shoestring.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,1610\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"Tipulo-Dishes-Shoestring\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/tipulo-dishes-shoestring.jpg?w=149\" data-large-file=\"https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/tipulo-dishes-shoestring.jpg?w=509\" src=\"https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/tipulo-dishes-shoestring.jpg?w=736\" alt=\"dishes at Tipulo Restaurant, Antipolol\" class=\"wp-image-8505\" srcset=\"https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/tipulo-dishes-shoestring.jpg?w=736 736w, https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/tipulo-dishes-shoestring.jpg?w=75 75w, https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/tipulo-dishes-shoestring.jpg?w=149 149w, https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/tipulo-dishes-shoestring.jpg?w=768 768w, https://shoestringdiary.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/tipulo-dishes-shoestring.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It was well before 11 AM when we arrived at Tipulo so we decided to have a light lunch. Coffee and dessert followed.

This is by a technicality, the true longest flight in the world. It is a couple of miles longer and about 5-10 minutes on average longer flying time than Newark EWR to SIN. Both are longer than the other direction from Singapore. Regardless all 4 flights are long and all clock in between 18-19 hours of flight time. They are operated by the only fleet of Airbus A350-900ULRs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12736\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220505_014702365/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_014702365.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220505_014702365\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_014702365.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_014702365.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12736\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_014702365.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220505_014702365\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_014702365.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_014702365.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_014702365.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>My Thoughts?</strong></h2>\n<p>A great way to fly, indeed. I was daunted, intimidated, and excited by the prospect of being on an airplane for 19 hours. I love flying, I love planes, but regardless that is a long span of uninterrupted time in a single seat, be it in business or premium economy class. Would it be endless? Would I be bored even with Krisworld’s extensive entertainment? Would I starve? Would I be super dehydrated? Turns out none of that happened. It is long, it is quite amazing that you get a full night’s sleep and you are not even halfway there yet. But Singapore Airlines has designed the service and flow of this flight to help you rest and ensure you arent tired or starving. The food offered is not overly heavy or rich which helps with not feeling too tired on the journey. The A350 is a quiet plane and technology on planes these days allow for a far less dry cabin. Singapore Airlines also managed to keep the cabin at, what was to me, just the right temperature. Not at all freezing or too warm, felt just right with a blanket while sleeping, didnt once sweat or shiver on the flight. It is, surprisingly to me, a fantastic flight. I can see why it is a popular option for people needing to fly to Singapore, Southeast Asia or Australasia. It is efficient, convenient, and comfortable. I have since heard from a few folks who have done it in both cabins and they agree it is one of their favorite flights in either cabin.</p>\n<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>\n<p>Singapore Airlines’ nonstop service from Singapore to New York has long been an aviation bucket list item for me ever since the airline first revolutionized nonstop flights in 2004 with their A340-500 “Leadership” aircraft in a largely business class cabin and what was named at the time “Executive Economy” which was an odd in between economy and premium economy. The plane then became a 100 seater business class only jet before the service was suspended in 2013 with the retirement of the A340-500 and rising fuel costs. They then relaunched the nonstop services to Newark and Los Angeles with the arrival of the A350-900ULR in 2018 in a 67 business class and 94 premium economy class (including 3 rows with the coveted “solo” premium economy window seats in the back) configuration.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12757\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220505_100619249/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_100619249.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220505_100619249\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_100619249.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_100619249.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12757\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_100619249.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220505_100619249\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_100619249.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_100619249.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_100619249.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<p>At first, it was only Newark to Singapore, which was already the longest flight in the world but in 2020 during the COVID Pandemic, the airline changed it to JFK. Now the airline flies both Newark and JFK as well as JFK through Frankfurt to Singapore on an <a href=\"https://gastronomictraveler.blog/2018/11/25/review-the-new-singapore-airlines-a380-suites-sin-zrh-a-thanksgiving-miracle/\">A380 with the suites</a>.</p>\n<p>Award availability on these nonstop flights are actually very hard to find, especially on saver awards, and after Singapore Airlines raised the award chart, its now 99,000 Krisflyer miles. For my itinerary of JFK-SIN-TPE, it is 110,000 Krisflyer miles. These flights do very well and are consistently full, especially these days as Singapore has opened up completely to vaccinated travelers. This time, I went for the JFK-SIN-TPE routing as this was an opportune way to get to experience the flight and also get me home to Taipei.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12763\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220505_125510042/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_125510042.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220505_125510042\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_125510042.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_125510042.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12763\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_125510042.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220505_125510042\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_125510042.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_125510042.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_125510042.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<p>At first there was only window seat available to select when I booked, which was 26K. I checked Expertflyer and saw that the entire front business class section was blocked off with a handful occupied. The bulkhead seats in the larger cabin, row 19, were available. However, not available to select on Singapore Airlines app or website. I called Krisflyer service line, and they were less than helpful as they just said no more seats to select when I asked to change my seat. Thankfully at check-in, which is 48 hours prior to departure on SQ, you could select row 19, and 19K bassinet bulkhead window seat was available, so I snatched it. The bulkhead seats are definitely preferable on these flights with the added legroom and space to stretch and sleep. Though I did test out the regular seats as one was empty, and its really not as bad as most aviation bloggers claim or complain about. Actually nothing about these seats is as dramatically bad as they all complain about.</p>\n<h1><strong>The Flight</strong></h1>\n<p>Date: May 4, 2022</p>\n<p>Flight: SQ 23, JFK – SIN</p>\n<p>Aircraft: 9V-SGD, A350-900ULR</p>\n<p>Distance: 9,542 miles, 18 Hours 35 Minutes; 23:05 Dep, 05:55 +2 Arr.</p>\n<p>Seat: 19K, Business Class</p>\n<h2><strong>Ground</strong></h2>\n<p>Check-in at JFK was a complete and utter mess. They system had failed earlier in the evening causing a massive line and delay for check-in on many airlines. The line was chaotic and disorganized though the contracted ground staff remained calm and did his best. They needed to get a full A380 on SQ 25 JFK-FRA-SIN quickly processed as it was 7:45PM and that flight left at 8:55PM. I was told to wait in line on the side with everyone else on SQ23, even though I observed many business class passengers bypassing this line. Everyone in my line was confused. It took about 50 minutes to fully process the SQ25 passengers. I had previously confirmed with the ground staff that ALL passengers on SQ23 was to line up in the line I was in. I later checked again, this time confirming I was in business, he apologized for the confusion and let me join Solitaire/Suites line as a service recovery move, which I was surprised and grateful for, I just wanted to join the correct line. Shortly thereafter I was checked in, docs checked and through CLEAR, as TSA Pre was closed by that time. Sadly, this meant I could not check out the American Express Centurion lounge as they close at 9PM.</p>\n<p>Singapore Airlines actually uses the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse at JFK. Its a great lounge with good food, drinks, seating and views. Though this time around, I felt service fell short. It might have been that since my last visit in January 2022, they updated the QR code Menu wherein you can order directly from the app, so the staff were not as proactive about approaching you, unless you were a VIP or frequent traveler it seemed. I did not eat too much at the lounge but had a pulled pork bao, and took the chance to drink up on lots of water, juice but also some champagne.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12735\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220505_012438020/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_012438020.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220505_012438020\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_012438020.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_012438020.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12735\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_012438020.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220505_012438020\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_012438020.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_012438020.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_012438020.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<p>I got to the gate early as I was just so excited. 30 minutes prior to departure, right on time, boarding commenced.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12734\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220505_010407309/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_010407309.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220505_010407309\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_010407309.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_010407309.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12734\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_010407309.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220505_010407309\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_010407309.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_010407309.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_010407309.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<h2><strong>Boarding </strong></h2>\n<p>The aft business class cabin is massive with 11 rows of business class seats.

The upper storage area has power outlets, and its smart of Singapore Airlines to have multiple headphone jacks, on either side of the seats. Touchscreen video monitor handset. There is also a large adjustable (height and position) tray table. One the armrest are seat controls and a do not disturb button. At the seat was a throw pillow and the care/sanitation kit, in the armrest storage was headphones and water bottle. The front of the seat houses the TV, bulkhead seats only have the mirror, regular seats have the added beverage stand. The footrest area of the bulkhead seats are their biggest selling point, so much space. This created for a comfortable sleep and space to stretch out and get comfortable.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12740\"

seat. The SQ App indicated amenity kits were available upon request. After the meal service, I asked, and was told they didnt carry any on this flight but instead had individual items and I was handed the eye mask, slippers and socks. Additional things such as combs, shaving kit are available in the lavatories. Not a huge bother for me as I do bring my own chapstick/hand lotion anyways, but a bit confusing and inconsistent with what the app said, a friend who flew SQ22 SIN-JFK the day before confirmed he also didnt have amenity kits.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12746\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220505_024247184/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_024247184.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220505_024247184\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_024247184.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_024247184.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12746\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_024247184.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220505_024247184\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_024247184.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_024247184.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_024247184.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12739\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220505_021554951/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_021554951.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220505_021554951\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_021554951.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_021554951.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12739\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_021554951.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220505_021554951\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_021554951.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_021554951.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_021554951.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<p>As boarding continued, the flight attendants came through with their pre-departure service. Which oddly did not include a pre-departure beverage offering of any sort. They came through to confirm any pre-order meals first, then took meal orders as well as post-departure beverage service orders. While SQ no longer hands out menus (what I gather it is now a permanent thing), the crew still do have a copy of a print menu for passengers to view in case they missed the memo that the menus are now all on the app. Apologies, I forgot to screenshot the menu before it became unavailable. The flight attendants also came through to offer the blanket, which hide behind the seat, and open the seal for you. Love this level of service and engagement with passengers. U.S. carriers barely come through to take the plastic wrappers of blankets / headphones from you. Of course, all crew addressed everyone by their names and in true SQ fashion, everyone was so nice, proactive and professional. Though, over all my crew on this flight weren’t exactly the most amazing exceed expectation SQ crew, but they were solid and no request was too much. I do think a few factors played into this, 1) it was a near full flight, and there are a lot of business class seats to service 2) its a long overnight flight and most passengers go right to sleep anyways 3) it is a long and grueling journey for them as well.  Yes, sometimes SQ crew may not feel as personable and a bit distant compared to more casual American or European crews, but they truly do offer exceptional and proper service.</p>\n<p>After the safety video, a short introduction video to business class seats was played including instructions on how to fold your seat into the bed. I didnt realize they did this. Most aviation bloggers write as if these seats require an engineering degree to operate and turn into a bed and that its only doable by a flight attendant, not so much. Is it the most practical or best seat design out there? Certainly not, but I was expecting so much worse based on everything I have read and watched.</p>\n<p>After a short delay with loading bags which were affected by the system outage, we pushed back and a short taxi later we were by the runway, at 11PM, there is not much of a rush hour at JFK, thank god. Soon we were airborne for our long journey across the Atlantic, over Europe, through the Middle East, over India and through Malaysia before arriving in Singapore. The flight now avoids Russian airspace.</p>\n<h2><strong>Inflight</strong></h2>\n<p>After we reached 10,000 feet, I reclined my seat and tried the various functions. Not too many functions or gadgets. But I was surprised that it was quite comfortable in a reclined position. It does not recline terribly far, but the legrest does come all the way up and its enough of a recline to be comfortable and relax in, not sure what all the complaints are about out there. Yes, in a normal seat you sort of have to sit sideways to get your legs fully stretched out into the footwell, but I am a side sleep and someone who sits and relaxes in weird positions, much to the detriment of my body, so I am not so bothered by this.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_12755\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-12755\" data-attachment-id=\"12755\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220505_052313464/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_052313464.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220505_052313464\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>Full reclined position</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_052313464.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_052313464.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12755\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_052313464.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220505_052313464\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_052313464.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_052313464.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_052313464.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-12755\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Full reclined position</p></div></p>\n<p>I was shortly brought my Singapore sling and nuts, due to COVID measures still in place, they still serve packaged instead of placing them in a saucer/plate.

First “lighter” meal service commences right after takeoff. The “main” meal service begins halfway through the flight and is offered up until 2 hours before arrival. In addition there are snacks and refreshments you can order, as well as snacks to grab from a snack basket in the galley. 1 champagne, 2 white wines, 2 reds, and a solid liquor / cocktail selection including an Aberfeldy 16 year, lots of teas and coffees to choose from. There are also a nice selection of non-alcoholic cocktails and beverages to choose from as well.</p>\n<p>After post-departure beverages, the cart began to roll through with the first meal service.

I decided to try for myself, and found it to be fairly intuitive and easy. You lift a latch in the back of the seat, fold it over, extend the mattress pad, and voila, a bed! There are two extra pillows provided as well. Total 3 pillows, a blanket and mattress pad, yes its a bit on the firmer side, but I dont mind, still found it to be a comfortable bed. Even more so in the bulkhead with all that extra room to stretch and move your feet and ability to sleep straight, though knowing how I often sleep, I’d have been ok with my feet in the cozy footwell, sleeping on my side/ at an angle.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12756\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220505_053110227/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_053110227.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220505_053110227\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_053110227.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_053110227.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12756\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_053110227.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220505_053110227\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_053110227.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_053110227.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220505_053110227.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<p>I woke up after a 5 or so hour sleep and saw that we still had 11 hours to go.

Currently and until May 22, there is only one SilverKris lounge for all business class passengers and a roped off section for First Class. Though on May 22 the new SilverKris lounge and First Class/Private Room are due to open. The lounge was quite large and quite packed at 8AM. There is a main buffet section serving up Indian, Singaporean and English breakfast options including Laksa. Grab and Go section with sandwiches, fruit cups. Self-serve alcohol sections as well as a full sit down bar at the front. Thankfully showers were open and available and that was my first stop as I had not showered for over 24 hours.</p>\n<p>I then found one of few remaining seats/ tables by the windows and grabbed a bit of dim sum, coffee and water. The lounge started to die down by 9AM as most passengers headed for connections to Australian/New Zealand or Southeast Asian destinations. Nonetheless, I did not stay too long and headed out to shop around, walk around and stretch my legs a bit before my next flight.</p>\n<h1><strong>SIN-TPE</strong></h1>\n<p>Date: May 6, 2022</p>\n<p>Flight: SQ878, SIN-TPE</p>\n<p>Aircraft: 9V-SCE, 787-10</p>\n<p>Distance: 2,004 miles, 4 Hours 25 Minutes, 11:45 Dep, 16:10 Arr.</p>\n<p>Seat: 17A, Business Class</p>\n<p>I headed to my gate in Terminal 2. 30 minutes prior to departure, boarding began.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12777\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220506_030134650/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_030134650.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220506_030134650\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_030134650.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_030134650.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12777\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_030134650.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220506_030134650\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_030134650.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_030134650.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_030134650.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<p>Singapore Airlines 787s are fitted with the airline’s regional business class, which are still in a 1-2-1 configuration and a lie flat seat, same ones used on <a href=\"https://gastronomictraveler.blog/2020/04/14/review-turkish-airlines-787-9-business-class-ist-atl-with-737-skd-ist/\">Turkish Airlines 787s</a> , which are truly a tad narrow.

The salad was refreshing with a nice dash of spice and zest.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12782\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220506_045106816/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045106816.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220506_045106816\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045106816.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045106816.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12782\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045106816.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220506_045106816\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045106816.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045106816.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045106816.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, more garlic bread</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"12783\" data-permalink=\"http://gastronomictraveler.blog/2022/05/15/review-worlds-longest-flight-on-singapore-airlines-sq23-jfk-sin-in-business-class/pxl_20220506_045349539/\" data-orig-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045349539.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"368,654\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"PXL_20220506_045349539\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045349539.jpeg?w=169\" data-large-file=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045349539.jpeg?w=368\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12783\" src=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045349539.jpeg\" alt=\"PXL_20220506_045349539\" width=\"368\" height=\"654\" srcset=\"https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045349539.jpeg 368w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045349539.jpeg?w=84&h=150 84w, https://garythegastronomictraveler.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pxl_20220506_045349539.jpeg?w=169&h=300 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" /></p>\n<p>Exit-Singapore flights longer than 4 hours have an extensive list for Singapore Airline’s famous book the cook service.

I then arrived in Taipei for a nightmare of a COVID arrival process. But thats another story.</p>\n<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>\n<p>As I said earlier, a great way to fly through and through. I would not hesitate to buy confirmed or redeem points and fly SQ23 or any of Singapore Airlines’ ultra long haul flights to get to Asia or Australia. They have designed and curated a thoroughly comfortable flight paired with tasty food, good wine and beverages and of course Singapore Airlines’ reputable service.</p>\n<p>Bon Voyage!</p>\n<p>TheGastronomicTraveler</p>\n",

        "title": "Lessons of War in Ukraine",
        "url": "http://benfoley.com/2022/05/15/lessons-of-war-in-ukraine/",
        "shorturl": "https://wp.me/p30N1O-2bP",
        "content": "\n<p>In this blog post, I want to surface a few lessons I am reflecting on from my time in war-torn Ukraine. These lessons relate to the reality of war, evil, suffering, courage, and hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Presence</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in this war, I realized words seemed to fall utterly short. Words felt trivial, even dismissive of the evil being experienced in many ways. There was nothing I could say that would remove the suffering and hellish realities people were experiencing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what did seem to matter and speak a message beyond words was presence. Simply being there for them in their time of need through prayer, listening, sharing in their suffering, and the generous support of many individuals, churches, and businesses, sent a message that we are with them. Over and over, people in Ukraine communicated that this is what they experienced. Further, their ability to be together during this time in our “Places of Hope” safe housing locations was critical to their sanity. Being able to bear one another’s burdens and share in the sorrow and do life together made the unbearable more bearable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, physically going and being present with them spoke volumes. The incarnation of Jesus took on new meaning even for me. Immanuel, God with us, has never meant more. The promise of the Holy Spirit being with us has never meant more. Presence matters sometimes beyond words. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Job’s friends got it right when they came and sat with Job in silence. It was when they began to speak that they only increased his suffering. And although Job thought he wanted answers from God, when God did speak, he overwhelmed him with his presence and the reality of who he is. In times of suffering, people need our silent presence. And this is profoundly powerful beyond words that might make us feel better but does not change the suffering people are enduring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Humor</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was surprised during our time in Ukraine at the amount of laughter and humor we experienced and shared in together. Perhaps it was partly a defense mechanism that kicked in to not go entirely crazy at the weight of the evil and suffering we were exposed to. But it got me reflecting on the subtle and often overlooked value of humor in diffusing situations. Humor certainly doesn’t diminish the pain, and suffering people go through. But humor has a way of defying evil having the last laugh. It may be purely coincidental, but it struck me that humor and humanity in English share the same first three letters. Could it be that humor restores our humanity? That part of what it means to be human is humor? I ordered some books upon my return to dig a little deeper into the science and psychology of humor and its importance in society. All I know is that it felt good to laugh and share humor with our Ukrainian friends amid the terrible suffering they are going through. And it seemed to be needed. Our director even commented that she hadn’t laughed that much since the war began. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Beauty </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It struck me that life and beauty were relentlessly and stubbornly continuing to break through despite the darkness and destruction. Spring was afoot in Ukraine, and flowers were refusing to yield to the devastation. It reminded us of the promise we have in Christ of restoration and the renewal of all things. That no matter what Satan unleashes upon this world, no matter what wicked people and leaders bring forth upon others, beauty and life will emerge even from the ashes. Hope will rise even from ground zero. There is a lot of darkness in the world. But there is also beauty. And though it does not make the level of noise evil makes, still it remains and endures long after evil has done its work. For all the hell on earth, it only makes the promise of heaven all the sweeter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Evil </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>War is terrible to begin with. But what I saw in Ukraine was a manifestation of pure evil. Civilians posing no threat were fired upon. Families trying to evacuate were killed just because soldiers could. Others were told to run, and then Russian soldiers fired over their heads to intimidate, humiliate, and make sport of. Young girls were sought out to be raped, including a three-year-old we heard about. People were left without food, electricity turned off, and residential homes, apartments, businesses, hospitals, orphanages, and schools were destroyed unnecessarily. Russian soldiers looted and stole from people’s homes and destroyed other items for no military objective but out of human jealousy and spite. We can’t deny the reality of evil in this world or this war. We can’t turn a blind eye to it. We can’t justify it, diminish it, deny it, or discredit it. We must face it head-on and call it for it is. It is pure evil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Propaganda</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I saw firsthand again the level of propaganda and misinformation Russia pumps out about this war and everything else to cause chaos, skepticism, confusion, and distraction. They throw out all kinds of narratives, false statements, and twisted lies to see what sticks and what people buy into. They project onto others what they are doing and are. We live in an age of misinformation, identity politics, deception, and fake news. We live in a world where truth doesn’t matter. Much of this has been created by Russian propaganda or inspired by their tactics. More than ever, discernment is needed. We are being played in so many ways, often via social media outlets, algorithms, bots, and fake accounts spewing out misinformation. The goal is not truth. The goal is not even a cohesive argument or logic. The goal is confusion and getting people to question what is going on. The goal is to get us to turn on one another. The goal is to distract us. Though more information is available than ever before, more propaganda is being believed than ever before. Therefore, discernment is needed more than ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Courage</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t want to end without noting the astonishing courage of the Ukrainian people. They have put up a fierce fight. Many endured the worst of it all in their homes and while helping neighbors. Others aided in evacuations. Still more stepped up to serve those in need despite their struggles. People are returning to cities early, even before electricity and water have been restored. They want to move on with their lives and go back to their lives despite all the destruction. They want to rebuild and show they will not be beaten by the evil perpetrated upon them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>War brings out the worst in some and the best in others. I have heard many stories and been with ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Common people are becoming heroes and saints even if they don’t feel that way or see themselves in that light. Russia has under-estimated Ukrainians and the response of the world. And while the world has watched in horror at Russia’s war on Ukraine, the world has also been inspired by the Ukrainian response and resilience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can learn from what is happening in Ukraine. We see the importance of presence, humor, beauty, and courage. We also must be wise to evil and propaganda. The real enemy, Satan himself, is shrewd and cunning. But the God we serve is good, loving, just, and true. Evil may have its moment. But good will always overcome evil and conquer in the end.</p>\n",

By the time he started T-ball he was hitting tape-measure shots, 565-foot home runs over everything. Eventually, we lowered the dose as the ‘roid-rage fines began to get expensive. I’ll never forget the look on the face of the teenaged umpire who called him out on a ball that just barely grazed the outside corner of the plate. My kid chased him back to his crappy Honda Civic and flipped it over–at the age of 10! That’s the kind of upper-body strength you need to hit with power to the opposite field.</p>\n<p>As any parent of a young athlete will tell you, a lot of sacrifice goes into the making of a kid who can play at the Division I level. There was the $45 per half hour hitting coach, the pseudo-religious earrings a la Barry Bonds, the heavy chains that look like they could have been lifted off the neck of a Rottweiler or an investment banker’s second wife. But it’s all part of the great American tradition of baseball.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/PCH7986.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.worldofstock.com/closeups/PCH7986.php&usg=__YzXys94GqHeSsn8qqsUm-EmxXNg=&h=500&w=337&sz=58&hl=en&start=8&sig2=jcx8zAHnpO36wnUfCId8Ug&um=1&tbnid=nVgB6_AchXHo3M:&tbnh=130&tbnw=88&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dyoung%2Bboy%2Band%2Bgirl%26hl%3Den%26um%3D1&ei=v00RSpDOEJik8gTr0uws\"><img src=\"http://tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:nVgB6_AchXHo3M:http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/PCH7986.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"88\" height=\"130\"></a><em><br />\n“I don’t really like you, but I’m 0 for 21 in June.”</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I don’t mean to suggest that my kid’s career has been one long home run trot around the basepaths.

        "content": "\n<p>It’s a lot of work trying to make people not realize they are slightly inconveniencing me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even though they likely do not care if they are or not, I continue on making different plans in my head just so that no one will think I am going out of my way for them.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>Take the other day, for example. I was at work and happened to be looking out the window. In case any of my bosses are reading this, it was the only time all day I looked up from my work glanced outside. I was probably trying to find more work to do!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I saw a woman walking toward the door with her hands full. I sit near the door and knew that if I didn’t open the door I would feel a little guilty, so I walked out of my office and down the hall quickly to open the door just before the woman went to open it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Well that was lucky timing,” she said, as I opened the door and stepped out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Oh yeah, it looks like it was,” I said as I pretended I was going outside and not opening the door for her. So she walked inside, and I kept going outside with no idea what to do next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my mind, I didn’t want her to know that I had opened the door for her, so I just walked out on the sidewalk and looked up at the trees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“No, that’s no good,” I thought to myself. “That will look silly. I should instead pretend like I’m waiting for someone. That makes more sense.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I looked to the right and the left, glanced down at the pretend watch on my wrist as if I was checking the time, and just stood there for a few minutes pretending that I was a responsible person waiting for someone. I even checked my phone while acting like I was looking for a message from the non-existent person I was pretending to wait for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few minutes of looking back and forth, I walked back inside to my office quickly hoping that the person would not see me. I needed to get back to work, after all, so that I could continue pretending to be a responsible person for my job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On another day, I went to lunch at the food court at work and decided to try the hot food bar. I had been studying the hot food bar for a few weeks, but usually just order the exact same thing at lunch. On this day, the food looked delicious so I decided I would finally try it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I went to wait in line, though, the woman in front of me spilled a whole bunch of sauce all over her tray and part of the food bar. It wasn’t her fault, it just happens. I saw it right after the spill, so I got some napkins to help her clean it up and tried to get the attention of someone working there. As she was cleaning everything up, I waited for a few minutes, but then realized I didn’t want her to know I was waiting for her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I went to another area and pretended to look at the food as if I was interested in buying it. While I pretended to check prices and nutrition contents on food items I would never buy, though, two other people got in line behind the original woman. So now the line was long and I decided that I couldn’t get back in it, so I gave up and went back to what I usually buy for lunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve found that I do the same thing in the grocery store. If someone is taking a long time in front of an area where I want to buy something, I pretend to look at something else so they won’t know I am waiting for them. I will pick up items that I have no idea how you eat them or even if you eat them, just so I can pretend to be a responsible shopper, and not someone who is waiting to buy Oreos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard work making sure people don’t know I am being inconvenienced, but I will keep doing it as much as I can. It may not matter to the other people, but it is fun to pretend to be a responsible person.</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I have a couple of questions about the total lunar eclipse that’s occurring tonight. First, where’s the best place to observe it? If you consult the <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/in/usa/iowa-city\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best advice</a> on how to watch it, you learn that the first phase (which in Iowa City, Iowa happens at 8:32 PM) is visible in the Southeastern part of the sky and at 3.4 degrees altitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great, it sounds like I need to be where there are no trees or buildings and lying on my belly. The next phase is at 9:27 PM, which is not much better because the altitude is only 11.4 degrees, at 129 degrees azimuth. I’m still learning this jargon, but again, do I need to be able to fly above the tree line to see the first couple of phases?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should we climb up on our roof to see the lunar eclipse?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any suggestions are welcome. The next question involves the well-known strangeness that happens during eclipses. Insects and other animals can get goofy about their diurnal cycles and, oh yeah, aliens get really gassy and develop uncontrolled farting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alien Flatulence Syndrome (AFS) is well-described in the scientific literature. No, I’m not going to have a list of references at the end of this post, and it’s for the same reason Beetlejuice won’t tell Lydia his name:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because if I tell you, you’ll tell your friends, your friends are callin’ me on the horn all the time, I gotta show up at shopping centers for openings and sign autographs and shit like that and it makes my life a *hell*. Okay? A living hell.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ask anyone on the Ancient Aliens crew for all the evidence you want that Blood Moons cause aliens to fart, then the bowel gas eruptions levitate them to the Blood Moon—where they open used flying saucer dealerships. And that’s the reason why you see so many UFOs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which leads us to the explanation for aliens shape-shifting into humans in order to live among us, and do things like play baseball like Exley in the historically accurate X-Files documentary “The Unnatural.” The real reason is they want to be able to buy Beano without being mobbed and forced to show up at shopping centers for openings, sign autographs and so on. Aliens hate lunar eclipses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may have to update this post as the lunar eclipse drama approaches tonight—if I can stay awake. This thing gets pretty close to our bedtime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to update us on the total lunar eclipse Blood Mood tonight, we can see the livestream on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MII89TZ63NE\" target=\"_blank\">timeanddate</a> if we’re yawning around the time it starts. Or you can wait for my snapshots, similar in quality to my previous shots of the Worm Moon and Snow Mood in 2021 (I’m just kidding, don’t do it!):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure data-carousel-extra='{\"blog_id\":159883853,\"permalink\":\"http:\\/\\/retirepsychiatrist.com\\/2022\\/05\\/15\\/do-blood-moons-make-aliens-fart\\/\"}'   class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-2 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2682\" data-permalink=\"http://retirepsychiatrist.com/2021/03/28/worm-moon-for-march-2021/worm-eagle-crow-moon-march2021-pic/\" data-orig-file=\"https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/worm-eagle-crow-moon-march2021-pic.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"Worm eagle crow moon March2021 pic\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/worm-eagle-crow-moon-march2021-pic.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/worm-eagle-crow-moon-march2021-pic.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"2682\"  src=\"https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/worm-eagle-crow-moon-march2021-pic.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2682\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"6148\" data-permalink=\"http://retirepsychiatrist.com/2022/05/15/do-blood-moons-make-aliens-fart/snow-moon-snapshot/\" data-orig-file=\"https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/snow-moon-snapshot.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"snow-moon-snapshot\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/snow-moon-snapshot.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/snow-moon-snapshot.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"6148\"  src=\"https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/snow-moon-snapshot.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6148\" srcset=\"https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/snow-moon-snapshot.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/snow-moon-snapshot.jpg?w=150 150w, https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/snow-moon-snapshot.jpg?w=300 300w, https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/snow-moon-snapshot.jpg?w=768 768w, https://retirepsychiatrist.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/snow-moon-snapshot.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n",

break (Which is what the front door’s for, but as I’ve learned from previous remodels, the construction peeps are treated like they have diplomatic immunity).  Anyway, he paced around while making a phone call to…. I’d assume some kind of significant other.  It’s actually rare to only get to listen to one side of a cellphone call these days given how many people use one of those face to face apps, whatever they’re called…</p>\n<p>The flooring company he works for is based way out in the sticks of Illinois, and he was wanting her to bring something to him… but was trying to budget for how much gas that trip would eat up.  He advised her to only put a few dollars in the tank at home, which should let her make it to some place down the highway where he said it was 40 cents cheaper a gallon.  But then he had another tip….</p>\n<p>“And use cruise control once you get on the highway!” he advised.</p>\n<p>One awkward pause later…..</p>\n<p>“Not birth control, CRUISE control!”</p>\n<p>Thankfully my break was about over at that time, because I needed to get back inside the store so I could laugh like a hyena….</p>\n<p><a

squirrel on his plinth.</p></div></p>\n<p>This snippet appeared in <em>Uncle John’s Curiously Compelling Bathroom Reader </em>under the category “Oops!” which chronicles amusing mistakes people have made, and was reprinted from the British newspaper <em>The Telegraph</em>:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><em>“One of Britain’s most prestigious art galleries put a block of slate on display, topped by a small piece of wood, in the mistaken belief it was a work of art.  The Royal Academy included the chunk of stone and the small bone-shaped wooden stick in its summer exhibition in London.  But the slate was actually a plinth — a slab on which a pedestal is placed — and the stick was designed to prop up a sculpture.  The sculpture itself — of a human head — was nowhere to be seen.  The Academy explained away the error by saying the parts were sent to the exhibition separately.  ‘Given their separate submission,’ it said in a statement, ‘the two parts were judged independently.  The head was rejected.  The base was thought to have merit and was accepted.'”</em></strong></p>\n<p>Just more proof that art is always in the eye of the beholder…</p>\n<p><div

He kept a well curated stack of humor cards – little stories or observations that he typed onto 5×7 cards. Then he wrote in the margins when he used that particular item. His humor was often an easy way to settle in to something deeper – by laughing and thinking about the buried truth in these little nuggets, it paved the way to an open heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we cleaned out his desk after he died 7 years ago, I was lucky enough to stumble on this stack. I pull it out regularly to have a little laugh with my dear Dad. Now when I post one of them, I write my note next to his and it feels like a continuation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Church Bulletin Bloopers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next Thursday there will be tryouts for the choir. They need all the help they can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barbara remains in the hospital and needs blood donors for more transfusions. She is also having trouble sleeping and requests tapes of Pastor Jack’s sermons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The outreach committee has enlisted 25 visitors to make calls on people who are not afflicted with any church.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pastor would appreciate it if the ladies of the congregation would lend him their girdles for the pancake breakfast next Sunday morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember in prayer those who are sick of our church and community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next Sunday Mrs. Vinson will be soloist for the morning service. The pastor will then speak on “It’s a terrible experience.” </p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>This has been the wackiest year of cycling since I started riding in 2011.  The weather all spring was ugly and uncooperative and I don’t know anyone up in miles from last year.  <em>No one</em>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the weather has taken a turn for the better and improved significantly to where we’re out in shorts and short sleeves.  I’m up to something resembling normal week numbers – after Saturday’s 49-mile ride on the tandem, I was sitting on 177 miles over the last seven days.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, my wife and I have been doing significant work on our marriage and we’re happier together than I can ever remember.  That blessing translated even to bike choice.  In previous years, we’d either choose single bikes and let the tandem sit, or only ride the tandem on Sunday mornings.  We’re choosing the tandem every time we ride together.  In fact, after some rudimentary math on the way out on a 50-mile out-and-back route, I realized I’ve got more miles on the tandem this year than I do on the <em>Venge</em> and I wouldn’t want it any other way.  Jess and I are actually talking about trading in our Periscope for a new Co-Motion Robusto – a significant increase in quality and a massive decrease in weight.  The changes also meant less time for cycling, but the benefits vastly outweigh missing some time on two wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I’d <em>rather</em> ride with my wife on a tandem.  So why not do that on something that would compliment our speedy nature rather than act as a boat anchor?  We bought our periscope so that we could have something that would fit a stoker as small as our young daughters, or my wife.  With the one of the girls off at college and the other halfway through high school (and neither enjoying cycling), it makes sense to get us onto something that fits <em>us</em> properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of my wife and I, a friend loves to say a tandem is a marriage maker, or a marriage breaker.  We made our marriage… then brought the tandem to the party.  For us, the tandem perfectly compliments where we are at, mentally and physically, in our marriage.  The better we’re doing as a couple, the more we enjoy riding the tandem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never thought I’d choose a 43-pound boat anchor over a 16-pound aero race bike.  But I do, and for that I am grateful.</p>\n",

Lately it seems as though Saturday slips up on me faster than it used to. So, what do I share with you this week?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary of 59 years this week, I thought it might be appropriate to share a bit of trivia with y’all relating to wedded bliss. Ever wonder where the term <strong><em>“Better Half” </em></strong>comes from?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality of the saying is that it is a tale from the Middle East. Yes, believe it or not, as I understand it, the origin of the modern spouse’s humility when introducing his mate as his “better half” came from a tear-jerking tale out of the Middle East.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the story goes – a Bedouin had offended his prince and as was the way things were back then, the husband was to be put to death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as luck would have it, the Bedouin’s wife truly loved him and pleaded for her spouse’s life by saying something that goes like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>“O great Prince, the blasphemy is horrible, I confess.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>But it is not my whole husband who has thus rendered himself guilty towards Thee.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>“Not thy whole husband,” the Prince replied.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>“Nay,” she continued, “it is but half, the half of him that has committed the insult; for am I not the other half, I who have never offended Thee?” Now the guilty half places itself under the protection of the innocent half and the latter cannot suffer the former to be punished.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">What are we to make of this – well, just this – it would appear that from this ancient concept of a man and woman being merged into one by marriage comes our phrase <em>“better half.” </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Don’t you feel so much smarter now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comical trivia:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Did you know that only Robinson Crusoe could have everything done by Friday.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Did you know that pigs are full of balony?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing that I have this thing about writing – did you know that:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>An editor makes a long story short.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, as you can see, words aren’t coming to me like they should be so here is a quote or two before I leave you for this week:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>“If you stumble, make it part of the dance.”</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>“In the book of life, the answers aren’t in the back.”</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Charles Schulz</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don’t remember anything about this week’s blog, remember this:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>“Life is like an ice cream. Enjoy it before it melts.”</em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://lakelandmusings.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/we-all-scream-for-ice-cream-2-1552333.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"3234\" data-permalink=\"https://lakelandmusings.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/better-half/we-all-scream-for-ice-cream-2-1552333/\" data-orig-file=\"https://lakelandmusings.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/we-all-scream-for-ice-cream-2-1552333.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"179,239\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"we-all-scream-for-ice-cream-2-1552333\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://lakelandmusings.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/we-all-scream-for-ice-cream-2-1552333.jpg?w=179\" data-large-file=\"https://lakelandmusings.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/we-all-scream-for-ice-cream-2-1552333.jpg?w=179\" src=\"https://lakelandmusings.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/we-all-scream-for-ice-cream-2-1552333.jpg?w=179\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3234\" width=\"179\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"https://lakelandmusings.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/we-all-scream-for-ice-cream-2-1552333.jpg 179w, https://lakelandmusings.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/we-all-scream-for-ice-cream-2-1552333.jpg?w=112 112w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Until next time!

My dog, Tess, was two and Boomer was older.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A small, part Beagle-part terrier, Boomer had not had a regular dog’s life. He had never eaten dog food and had never been on a leash.  He was served a piece of Kentucky Fried chicken on a plate the first time I ate dinner at my fiance’s house, a house he shared with his mom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boomer stared up at me through the glass table top as if to say, “Who are you and what are you doing here?” Future hubby’s mother had the same look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tess and Boomer had fun romping through the park together, although Boomer was just a little guy, about ten pounds, and Tess was a medium sized dog at 40 pounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We got married in Omaha, and for our honeymoon, we drove halfway across the country with Tess in her crate in the back seat and Boomer on my lap, shooting gassy farts at me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My husband laughed and laughed.  We were in my tiny 4-cylinder Chevy, and the January winds blowing across Kansas kept us from reaching the speed limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boomer settled into his California digs and learned how to eat dog food. My husband insisted on giving him table scraps as well. Both dogs got fat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the babies disrupted Boomer’s life some more. He didn’t like children much, having been teased by one as a puppy. He’d snap at the baby if she got too close. Tess, on the other hand, let kids sit on her back while she lay on the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time we had two kids, Boomer was turning gray. We had moved into our second California house, and he was having trouble seeing and hearing me call him for dinner. My husband traveled a lot, which left me to care for his aging pet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One night, Boomer went out the laundry room doggie door to the garage and then the side doggie door to the yard. He couldn’t find his way back, and he ended up in an open metal lunch box, barking because he couldn’t get out of it. I was freaked out, very pregnant, home alone, and too afraid to get him out of his predicament at 3:00 a.m. We’d had raccoons come into the garage through the side door. I saved him at sun-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were two steps down to the garage from the laundry room door. One day I stepped out the door to the garage and tripped over carpet that had been nailed to the steps by my husband. He hadn’t bothered to tell me that he did that to help out his dog. I was furious (being very pregnant) that my husband had created a trip hazard for me. I had to explain to him what a fall might mean to the baby. I tore the carpet off the steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boomer’s quality of life kept deteriorating.  I suggested that it was time to put him out of his misery. My husband disagreed. We went round and round about it until Boomer had to be carried in and out to pee. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put my foot down.  My husband did the deed but never forgave me for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, pets!  It is so hard to say good-bye, but until someone breeds a dog that can live as long as humans do, it is part of life, and there’s no avoiding it.</p>\n",

My plastic front bumper cracked and fell mostly off, but duct tape is a wonderful thing. I wasn’t hurt. I was pulling out of a parking lot, trying to make a left turn across two lanes and a center turn lane, when <strong>BAM!</strong></em> <em>I was smacking into the rear passenger wheel of an SUV. It turned into a big drama with police,  fire department and the ladies left in an ambulance 🙄 The driver wanted to wait for her husband before climbing into the ambulance,  but the paramedics told her if she was hurt enough to be transported, she needed to go now. Hmmm… what else? Daughter has Bronchitis again, or still🤷🏼‍♀️ It seems she’s been coughing her head off forever.  I took her to Urgent Care for another inhaler and some prednisone. That was Friday. The same day Ben stayed home from school with a gut bug. Fun times at the <strong>Casa</strong>😵‍💫</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prompt words for this week are – <strong>Head, Hat, Hair, Scarf</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought about using a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LG8EUwOhrVw\">Metallica</a> song, but didn’t think it would appeal to as many listeners. So, I went with on old song sung by a guy who is really named Taco. His full name is Taco Ockerse. He was born in Jakarta to Dutch parents, and raised in Germany.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He performed old show tunes in supper clubs. Then in 1982 he released an album called <em>After Eight </em>with <strong><em>Puttin’ On The Ritz</em></strong> released as a single, with a video made for new channel MTV. The heavy rotation on MTV combined with the catchy song written by the great Irving Berlin, sent Taco’s song to #4 on Billboard in the US. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.songfacts.com/facts/taco/puttin-on-the-ritz\">Songfacts</a> had a cool bit of trivia …The success of Taco’s cover made 95-year-old Irving Berlin the oldest living songwriter ever with a single in the Top 10 of the Hot 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This song, though not Taco’s version, was featured in a classic comedy movie. How many of you know the movie?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4OUnedMCCW0?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en&autohide=2&wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re blue, and you don’t know where to go to<br>Why don’t you go where fashion sits?

Regular chatterbox.\" src=\"https://spwilcenwrites.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/noir.png\" alt=\"\"><br><em><strong>graphix: spwilcen</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Episode IX</strong><br><strong>Darkside Tommy</strong></h6>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrying a small duffle bag jammed with underwear, tees, socks, my shaving gear, and three pair of clean Levi’s, I pounded the button on the garage wall to open the garage door. Someone or something with a two-pack-a-day cigarette habit gravelled my name. It caught me by surprise.  Actually, put me in that precarious situation where both exhaust sphincters spasmed almost to the point of release. Probably, it being Tuesday, I had on clean tighty-whities, and laundry wasn’t until Saturday, natural urges lost out to good potty-training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yeah, that’s me,” I replied out of reflex as one does when your strength is as the strength of ten because your heart is pure. Immediately reconsidering, I realized people are for the most part correct when they tell me, ‘You have shit for brains.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cigarettes launched into his sales pitch. “Jimmy Lewiston says I gotta bust both your kneecaps.  Capeesh?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could <em>hear </em>cigarettes but couldn’t <em>see</em> him.  I considered running. While I still <em>had</em> kneecaps.  I stalled, “Capeesh?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yeah. Allus wanted to say that.  Eye-tal-yin you know, for ‘you dig?’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What!  Bust kneecaps? What for?” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Spoiled his niece’s wedding.  His favorite niece.” The most nondescript man you’d ever see stepped into the light of the open garage door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expecting anyone nefarious enough to smash kneecaps for a living to look at least a little sinister, I was disappointed Mister Lewiston had dispatched Tommy Nondescript to take care of business.  I also wondered if the dark web’s lackluster description of me was a good or bad thing. Tommy Disappointing giving away twenty pounds in my favor and looking like he’d hadn’t slept well in a week, I was foolishly encouraged.  “I never heard of the man. I’m thinking mistaken identity. This Lewiston guy give you anything besides a name?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Got a picture.” Tommy reached into his inside suitcoat pocket. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I flinched.  An inside pocket was too small for a baseball bat but about the right size for a small caliber pistol. Kneecaps still intact, I could outrun a baseball bat but didn’t have much chance outrunning a gunshot. Then again, I supposed kneecaps could be broken by well-placed gunshots with less effort than using a 36-inch Louisville Slugger. I breathed a sigh of relief, sort of, when Tommy pulled out a photograph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Man, you don’t look nothing like this,” mused Tommy.  “Here.  Lookit. You know this guy?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That’s not me! That’s one <em><strong>ugly </strong></em>man!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Clearly not you. But do you <em>know </em>him?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Never seen him before.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Well, good thing for you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You mean you aren’t gonna bust my knees anyway?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You think I do this for fun?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Well, dunno.  Never met a kneecap guy before.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Kneecap guy.  That’s funny.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Not to me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s a job, man. Well, that’s the breaks.  No pun there, fella.  Ah, well, shit.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Not ‘ah shit!’ as far as I’m concerned.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Understand. But look at it from my point of view.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“How’s that?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I got expenses, you know?  Any idea what airfare is to this hick place?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“From where?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“From South… Um, let’s just say I ain’t local. Cost me a bundle.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Well maybe you can pick up a little odd job on the side?” Up close, Tommy smelled of garlic and Old Spice, but not of cigarettes. “Say, you don’t smoke?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Naw. Ain’t healthy, you know.  Why?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Just curious.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unh, yeah. Okay. About this ‘side job.’ Whaddaya mean?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Well there’s this woman, down at the state offices…”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Don’t do citizen contracts.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Why not?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Pay stinks. I mean corporations and cabals can pay, you know? John Average…” Tommy shrugged. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Not so much, eh?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Right. Besides you said ‘a woman.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Did. You interested?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“No.  Woman. Too dangerous.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Oh, I see.  A sissy huh?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Nothing sissy about it. Gotta be more careful.  Women are pack animals. Hard to isolate, see?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Yeah, guess so.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“So I’d rather not, all the same to you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Too bad.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Love to stay and chat but I gotta check with Mister Lewiston.  See what he wants I should do next.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sorry to disappoint.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At’s okay. Have a nice day.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>—</p>\n",

That’s been due to the busy schedule, but here’s a thought we’ve had after watching a movie. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theoretically, there an infinite number of universes where for every thought, every scenario is happening simultaneously right now as we type this out. After watching a recent movie, a box office hit if I might add, every dream we’ve had there’s a reality in which it’s happened.  <em>(Yes even the one where we show up to class with no pants, that’s a really common one am I right?)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can’t help but wonder how the other life lives, as somewhere out in the universe, there’s a version of me dreaming about me or somehow wanting a version of my existence. Then again I’m convinced we’re all living in a simulation much like SIMS, where the Almighty himself is actually just a guy at a computer controlling our actions. Ever have that feeling where you walk in a room and suddenly forget why you were there in the first place? Boom. Sims game, bet you didn’t think that was the reason, huh? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But no, if the multiverse is a real thing, when can I dimension jump to the version who’s a millionaire? In other news, I’ve realized life is full of twists and turns, and they’re usually better executed than a novel written by a crudely published author, but sometimes we just have to ride them out these series of unfortunate events. I really don’t have much to comment on aside from the day to day musings. I’m making changes little at a time and putting out there that things will get better. I’m manifesting the things I want instead of acting passively. I’m taking charge of the chaos and owning it. I’m not mind controlling an entire town and bending them to my every will, because that’s NOT possible.  Life’s too short to worry about the little nuisances, instead look at the bigger picture and go forth into the world and be the keeper of your destiny. I’m ready for a vacation and I plan to use it for charging and making use of my free time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until Next Time, </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\">Drew </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"227\" data-permalink=\"https://adcamper92.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/my-multiverse-of-may-hem-5-14-22/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae/\" data-orig-file=\"https://adcamper92.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1440,1800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"1"}\" data-image-title=\"c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://adcamper92.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae.jpg?w=240\" data-large-file=\"https://adcamper92.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae.jpg?w=819\" src=\"https://adcamper92.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae.jpg?w=819\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-227\" srcset=\"https://adcamper92.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae.jpg?w=819 819w, https://adcamper92.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae.jpg?w=120 120w, https://adcamper92.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae.jpg?w=240 240w, https://adcamper92.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae.jpg?w=768 768w, https://adcamper92.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/c3032399-7712-4c1d-b0ac-cd276e5143ae.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /><figcaption>No relevance just liked the picture.

It was a simple job that I became one of the MVPs of, who trained all the new people because the girl who did the training left after she was done with college. It was a pretty decent gig for a college student, where I could work part time and have some spending money when I was living in the dorms and needed some extra cash for gas or whatever. I met one of my current best friends there, had a friendship with someone go sour because of their jealous husband, and shocking everyone who worked there that a titan of my size could somehow disappear in that place. I got a few stories, and I felt like sharing two of them with you.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The first is about a girl and a guy coming into the place in summer.  Here’s something to know about the Library in the summer – it gets hot.  There are HUGE windows that have direct sunlight coming into them all day, so it gets pretty hot, pretty quick.  One of the perks of this, for a young man in college, is that a lot of women end up taking off layers in that joint.  Now don’t worry, I wasn’t overtly ogling them.  I may be something of a libertine, but I’m at least classy about it.  However, when you are able to enjoy the view, you do so in the discreet manner of which you become VERY accustomed to.  And MAN, being a titan who stands just under 7ft tall comes in handy at no time better than this.  Neat fact – a gay girly-mate came to the Library sometimes to chill with me, and she could overtly ogle and no woman ever said a word.  In fact, one chick was flattered.  Gay women really can get away with anything.  A fact that she never stopped finding funny.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, we have these study rooms that students can rent for a set time period.  We unlock them, they have their full time period, and then they leave.  It automatically locks when they go, so we don’t have to do anything.  One day, a guy and a girl show up in the height of summer.  These rooms have a full view, so if you’re thinking people can use them to fuck, you’re sadly mistaken.  But it was clear right off the bat that this guy and this girl had VERY different ideas about why they were here, and I’m about to shock you – the genders you’re thinking it is are wrong.</p>\r\n<p>This guy looked like such a dork, and was he ALL about the studying.  He was keeping on task so well.  I know this because I was shelving in the section across from the study room, and occasionally I would see what was going on in there.  This guy was all about the books, but this girl was somewhere COMPLETELY different.  You ever seen a chick throw herself at a guy so much that there are pretty much landing lights to her snatch?  Yeah, that was this.  I’ve never seen a woman be more overtly sexual in my entire life.  She was throwing herself at this guy so hard.  What made this interesting is that the dork guy didn’t seem to notice this, at ALL.  As the afternoon went on, and I kept finding reasons to stay in this section because this was getting fun to watch, it became clear that she was getting very, very frustrated with this guy’s lack of awareness of what she is trying to do.  I half expected her to hit him and yell at him and ask what his deal is, that’s how ugly the expression on her face got.</p>\r\n<p>The day ends with the two of them leaving, and I could see this chick looked PISSED.  As fate would have it, I was at the front desk when they came back and told the desk staff that they were done with the room.  And I swear, I thought I heard this chick whisper to herself, “I wasted my entire fucking day…”  I have no idea what she sees in that dork, but I guess he is the most clueless man in existence.</p>\r\n<p>Another story worth telling is the fact that we had computers at the Library.  People would come in to print papers, research stuff, or just use the Internet for whatever.  By and large, it was pretty chill.  The computers were all plainly visible to anyone, so I’ve never had anyone stupid enough to look up porn there.  However, one day, I had a neat little interaction with a guy who decided that he was going to look for love on the Library computers.  Not the dating app kind of love, but the “she has no choice but to be with me” kind.  That’s right, this dude was actually looking up Russian mail-order brides on the Library computers. </p>\r\n<p>Now, I’m not entirely sure what to do in this situation.  On the one hand, it isn’t porn.  There’s nothing explicit on this site.  All the women being shown are fully clothed.  But this is clearly awkward and I could tell was making at least one person who was at a computer nearby uncomfortable.  Maybe it was the noises this guy was making when he was looking at the various women who were on offer from this I’m sure totally legit service.  I go to the front desk and ask what the protocol is, and they’re just as amused as I am.  The gal there tells me to talk to the guy, but do it quietly and not make a big deal out of it.  Which means, in other words, that I’m basically stuck trying to find a way to get this guy out of here without making a scene.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone who knows me knows that I am a consummate smart-ass, so I decide that I’m going to take the very direct approach with this.  I walk over, grab a chair from a desk that isn’t occupied, and park it right next to this guy.  He smelled weird.  I can’t describe the smell.  It’s like some kind of mix between fish and gasoline.  No wonder he’s looking for a mail-order bride.  Dude doesn’t even notice.  He’s 100% focused on these Russian women that he is looking to purchase for his…needs.  I get right next to the guy and very quietly go, “oh man, that one looks good!  What do you think?”  Needless to say, the guy looks up in shock and starts making excuses that he just ended up there.  I was told not to make a scene, so I decide to keep to that criteria.  Leaning in real close, I go, “look, buddy, I don’t care where you decide to look for love of the illegal kind, but if you could not do it here, that would be great.” </p>\r\n<p>The stinky man got right up and decided to shuffle away very quickly, face beet red, clearly awkward about the whole interaction and left.  I put the chair back at the desk, logged the computer out, and then had a gal who was nearby him and uncomfortable thank me.  It was a strange but good day at the Library.</p>\r\n<p>I have a few more of these stories, and I think I’ll save those for another post.</p>\r\n<p>Until next time, a quote,</p>\r\n<p>“Where the fuck do you keep disappearing to?  You’re huge!  How do you hide out there?!” – Coworker</p>\r\n<p>Peace out,</p>\r\n<p>Maverick</p>\r\n",

        "content": "\n<p>There sat, around a campfire, four brave souls spending the last night they had left before an epic adventure was to unfold.<br>The first was a thief. Small in nature and twitchy like a rat, he smiled to himself as he gazed upon the flames. They were gold like the thoughts swimming in his head. Mere hours from now, he just knew it, his hands would have coins and jewels dripping from the fingertips. Oh the things he would do with it! He pawed at the air absently as if to scoop in the invisible treasure and will it into reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next to him, a little further away, sat a wizard. He looked, almost, as most wizards would with his long grey robes and matching beard. He had an unlit pipe hanging from his lips precariously as a large belch needed the extra room to escape. Unlike most other wizards, as could now be made apparent, this one was….incredibly gross. He scratched at his beard and the warrior we haven’t met yet was almost sure he saw fleas skittering around the matts. Everyone sat away from him to avoid said fleas (and smell) and tried to play it off as a respectful sort of fear of his power. After all, dirty or not, he could still turn them all into toads if he so pleased. <br>“I heard he doesn’t bathe on purpose” someone (who is now no longer with the party) had whispered once. “Believes it will taint the magic somehow. But I think he really just wants an excuse not to bother with it.” The speaker had been a goblin. A good goblin, really, for as long as he had been around. Such a shame to have lost him so soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across from the thief sat the noble warrior. His armor (or at least the parts that hadn’t rusted over) were engraved with the design of his familys’ crest. And around his shoulders, he wrapped himself in the remnants of a faded purple banner. The very one he had once raised high in the air on a staff of fine mahogany. A marker for all to see the glory of his family and name….<br>But that was a long time ago. Back before the fall of his kingdom. If the thief dreamed of gold, the warrior dreamed of glory. Somewhere, at the end of their venture, there was rumored to be a creature of such power, that anything one imagined could be made real. And there was nothing the weathered warrior imagined more often than a way to take back the shame he felt when he failed to vanquish the dragon that brought ruin (and yet more shame) to his kingdom and family name. (In case you missed it, he’s kinda fixated on this family name thing.)<br>The warrior heaved a heavy sigh and then immediately looked aghast, as the wizard had stood up to relieve himself in plain view for all to see. Where once there was a new moon, now it was apparently full. What magic he had indeed.<br>There was an awkward cough and all parties tried as hard as they could to find a place, any place, to look away from the aging man urinating next to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, in his own corner, sat our last member. Unlike others, he wasn’t gazing at the fire or some imagined outcome. But rather, he sat lovingly polishing the wood of his lute. For our last member, as you guessed it, was none other than the games’ token Bard. He wasn’t originally a part of the crew. There seemed to be rules of there being only 4 allowed (and there had been 4, at one point he was told) but while at a tavern, as he sat getting deeper into his drinks, a vacancy had apparently “magically” appeared. And, as he was drunk and aimed to be moreso, and they seemed to have the coin for it, he found himself stumbling into their….fine, company. It wasn’t until much later that he was sober enough to realize the mistake he had made. Regardless, he was a collector of stories and writer of tales so he decided to stay and see how this one unfolded. As to whether it would be an epic song or yet another sad comedy, he had yet to decide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that introductions have been properly made, we’ll fast forward a bit so we don’t get bored. The fire had long since turned to embers and the “moon” was off in his corner snoring loudly. And off in the distance, the sky was growing lighter as the sun decided the day was ready to begin.<br>And begin it did. With groans aplenty. The team stirred and woke up. The grinding from the warriors armor was the only thing to be improved by the sheet of moisture the dew left behind.<br>“You know, the stories always describe mornings like this as being beautiful and all but I just feel….soggy.” said one<br>“Yeah well, whoever said that hasn’t had to camp with nothing but a bed roll to use for shelter” said another<br>And the wizard just grunted and the fire was returned to its blazing glory.<br>The Bard wondered, again, if it was too late in the game to go home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward a little more, our troupe stood stoicly at the entrance of a large cave. Signs hung, here and there, warning all travelers to beware.<br>The thief, as he had high stealth stats, went in first.<br>The tunnel leading inward was dark and narrow. The ceiling dripped here and there and the sounds echoed on and on. Still, the thief knew what he was doing. Working in the dark was how he worked best, and he continued to the back of the cavern to where he knew his treasure would lie.<br>And just as he had wished: there it was. It glowed, as if on its own accord, sending golden hues dancing onto the walls nearby. If a holy choir of angels could be heard singing, our thief was ready and willing to sing along. Because there is was! The treasure! And he was the first to find it, completely alone, with no one around to be a witness. The thief let out an excited squeak and jumped for joy before running to claim his prize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From outside the cave, it wasnt an excited squeak but a wild scream that could be heard echoing from inside. The agonizing sound carried long and far to the ears of the rest of the crew. The wizard let out a humph in response and the warrior, ready to return glory to his name (as always), unsheathed his screeching sword and went running in after him. The wizard followed next lighting the path with his staff. The Bard, excited by the change of events in spite of himself, followed at the rear, playing tunes on his lute to add to the suspense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scene found at the end of the cavern was unlike what any, one person, could have imagined. From an old chest of dirty clothes in the back, wafted up a genie like creature. Only it wasn’t a genie, it was a 2-headed dragon enraged at being disturbed.<br>The warrior yowled with fury at the sight of it.<br>“it lives! It lives still! The dragon from my kingdom!” and the dragon rawred and filled the ceiling with bristling flame.<br>“You fools! You’ll kill us all!” shouted the wizard, his voice could be heard from above the chaos of noise and shouts. “It becomes whatever you imagine! Whatever you think and it will be so!” and in response, for a split second, the creature’s flesh boiled and rippled as it changed shape to take on a new, more deadly, form.<br>“Think of something else! Anything else!” <br>Suddenly the rippling stopped and the dragons’ fire was sucked back in. The creature started to grow in size like a balloon being inflated. The color leeched and the dragon’s many horns grew thin and sparse until the shape was completely changed.<br>The Bard’s eyes grew wide in horror as realization set in, his lute hanging idly at his side.<br>The new monster, in the shape of a gaint old wizards sagging butt now came bouncing towards them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More deadly indeed.</p>\n",

It’s time for my wife to go to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She kisses me on the cheek, “Bye, honey,” she says, “I’ll see you tonight.” I put my arm around her waist and pull her closer, press my lips to hers for a brief second and break away with an intentional smacking sound. “Love you,” I say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Love you, too” She says as I turn back to my work. Then after a moment she adds, “What are you working on?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I notice she has glanced at my computer screen. <em>A betrayal! </em>I quickly click to a different tab on my screen. My jaw clenches in an effort to restrain my tongue. <em>What am I working on? Who is </em>she<em> to ask what I’m working on? How am I supposed to know? Now, I guess I have to stop—in the middle of what I’m working on—and answer these asinine questions. I swear this is intolerable.</em> Finally I calmed down enough to speak. “I’m writing,” I mutter through slightly parted teeth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Oh, neat! What about?” She asks it with a bubbly ring in her voice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This is ridiculous. I will not be interrogated in my own house!</em> <em>I need something non-committal. I can’t tell her what I’m really writing about, because I’m not even sure. And she’ll think I don’t know what I’m doing if I say that. Okay, got it. </em>“I’m just working on some different stories. You know… the usual.” <em>Nice. That should satisfy her sadistic quest to pump information out of me.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’d like to read it,” she says, “I’m sure it’s wonderful with how much you’ve been working on it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My teeth clench so hard I feel my heartbeat in my jaw. I exhale quickly and angrily through my nose. <em>Can I afford a divorce? Psh, trying to read something that is a work in progress? I can’t believe her. That should be a crime! </em>“You should really head to work.” I don’t even look up.<br>She stands still for a moment, palpably angry. She then leaves and shuts the door without another word. <em>How am I supposed to write now? I’m fuming! </em>I wait for the garage door to close, and then go back to bed for my morning nap.</p>\n",

In her new role, she will be recognized as one of Sauron’s most devoted followers—serving as his trusted herald and messenger, spinning all of Sauron’s lies into a narrative, deflecting legitimate questions, and of course, circling back later.</p>\n<p>“The White House was just a stepping stone for where I wanted to go in my career. I think my work speaks for itself, which is why I was selected personally to serve the Dark Lord himself,” announced Jen Psaki from the Dark Tower. “I will be one of the few servants of Mordor able to communicate directly with Sauron. Yippee!”</p>\n<p>“Obfuscating the truth comes naturally for her,” said Gothmang Kurbag, lieutenant of Mordor’s 9th battalion. “It’s not every age of Middle Earth we see someone this talented at spreading disinformation and silencing those who would speak the truth.”</p>\n<p>According to sources, Jen Psaki settled into her new role quickly. She was already masterfully pinning the woes of Middle Earth onto the Gondorian Nationalists when confronted at the Black Gate. “My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome. Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me? Or indeed with wit to understand me?” she said, flashing a brief cruel smile. “Indeed, inflation, soaring oats prices, war, and sickness throughout the land are a direct result of the Dark Lord’s predecessor and his ilk.”</p>\n<p>At publishing time, the Mouth of Sauron dismissed Trump’s claims of being the Great MAGA King. She tossed a discarded buffalo hat onto the ground as a token signifying their failure. “Aha, I was bidden to show thee,” she said. “I want you to know he suffered greatly, Donald.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://babylonbee.com/news/jen-psaki-steps-down-as-white-house-press-secretary-to-take-position-as-the-mouth-of-sauron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://babylonbee.com/news/jen-psaki-steps-down-as-white-house-press-secretary-to-take-position-as-the-mouth-of-sauron</a></p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>While driving around this past week, I passed a local high school with a huge first responder presence. At first I feared a major tragedy, but on closer inspection I realized this school was participating in a “Shattered Dreams” enactment. The program involves graphic presentations of how poor choices involving drugs, alcohol, or texting while driving can result in often tragic and permanent consequences. It is a call to parents and students to “get your house in order.” Everyone watching knows that the events depicted are fictional, but the impact and associated emotions are quite real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suddenly was reminded of many such programs from my past in education, and especially the one that included Cameron as one of the “victims.” The parents of these “victims” were requested to write a letter to their child, an offering of what they would have wanted say before such a tragedy. It was the most difficult thing that I have ever written. Some parents agreed to read their letters to the whole assembly of students. Barely able to contain my emotions while writing the letter, I declined the opportunity to read it aloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I drove on home remembering a field of simple white crosses outside the event that year with Cameron. I had pulled up the one with her name on it and placed it our backyard garden. Over the next ten years her name had faded and the wood had degraded to compost. But as I entered the yard, I could see it in my mind as clearly as it appeared with the others at Keller High School that spring day. Happening upon that emotion charged event this week was a reminder that my words and actions of caring should not be withheld for a future time. Loving each other is not to be delayed. Love requires our words and our actions now, especially now, as Cameron and Hunter become parents themselves this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover.” Today “putting your affairs in order” is generally a call to make necessary financial arrangements because the time to accomplish such work is limited. How much long-term financial order one can achieve under an emotion charged time constraint is questionable, although I suppose that it is doable. Regardless of our financial condition, the order and balance of our being requires daily attention to the details. All our assets will be distributed, whether by our plan or another’s, but how our life is distributed is totally in our hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the last supper, Jesus knew his time with the disciples was very short. He was like a dying man, saying what was most important to him. While Judas had walked away from the twelve, the Messiah knew all of them were sinners, weak, and fallible. Jesus knew that neither the disciples, nor any of us could reach the kingdom of heaven simply following the law and commandments. Jesus also knew that his love for them was greater than their shortcomings. Therefore, Jesus then gave a final charge, which is most difficult for the weak, the sinner, or the selfish. His word did not require a stone tablet, nor an ark to hold it. Jesus and the Spirit had given the disciples, and given us, the knowledge and power to continue his works. However, his new commandment requires a personal commitment to be recognized as a follower of Jesus. “Loving others as He loves us” is a commitment that cannot be delayed until some comfortable, later, time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pax,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>jbt</p>\n",

        "content": "\n<p>Guest post by CJ Obray</p>\n\n\n\n<p>15 May 2022</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is for those UTBOH watchers who are frustrated by departures from historical accuracy and also frustrated that Brenda Lafferty’s voice seems to be getting lost from the narrative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, and yes. I see you. I hear you. I don’t disagree with you. Brenda’s voice certainly and absolutely deserves to be heard. She was literally and brutally silenced by people who saw her as a threat to their power and purpose. She was the target of very specific animas because she had the audacity to think, speak, and behave as a sentient individual in a community that did not value her for anything other than her ability to reproduce and to bow and scrape in obeisance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is precisely the point. Brenda’s voice was harshly removed from the narrative, not just from the narrative of this story, but from the larger narrative of our collective lives. We miss her. We miss her shining confidence, her kindness, her gentleness, her intelligence, her influence for good. What have we lost because she is gone? We can only guess. What we are left with is a world, and a story, that is darker and bleaker without her in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allegorically, Brenda’s character in the story can be seen as a representation of what the world loses because of the marginalization, the oppression, the silencing of women by men who believe the God-given role of women is to serve the men around them. Horrific murder is certainly the most emphatic way of keeping women from stepping out of “their place,” but it’s not the only way. If you’ve noticed the plot progression that has virtually all of the female characters in the story gradually being told to defer to male authority, hush up, or worse, please remember that this is authentic for the time and place in which the story is set. You may quibble over whether the hair or clothing styles are right for 1984 in Utah County, or whether the regional pronunciations or idioms are on-point, but the larger vibe in the story is bang-on: very real social and theological forces at work in the Lafferty family and in the community caught Brenda in a vortex from which she was ill-equipped to escape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s your historical accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this story – the story of how the Lafferty brothers went from being fairly normal mainstream Mormon brethren to frighteningly free-lance fundamentalists – Brenda’s story is, unfortunately, a painful and all-too-brief moment in the timeline. For the Lafferty brothers, the story was always and only about them and how they were going to ascend to glory. They weren’t concerned about anything or anyone else, as is evidenced by how they treated their own wives, sisters, daughters, and mother. Anyone who didn’t go along to get along was in as much peril as Brenda was, and – although they all were aware of how terrible their existence could become if they didn’t fall into line – they were probably all hoping their concerns were unfounded, and likely didn’t dare voice them out loud, not even to each other, for fear of retaliation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you convey that fear visually? Through scenes showing Grandma Lafferty explaining to Matilda what her duty is and that she must always prop up her husband without him knowing she’s doing it, through Dan and his brothers ordering Brenda to shut up and stop asking questions so she doesn’t look like an “idiot,” through Matilda cowering in the passenger seat as Dan speeds recklessly down the highway while he’s shouting at her, and Ron forcibly shoving Dianna into their vehicle after he finds out she’s been writing letters to church leaders without his knowledge. Even in the kinder, gentler environment of the Pyre household, Jeb finds ways to remind Becca that whenever there’s a conflict, she’s supposed to put her ideas and feelings aside in favor of his priesthood authority, whether he’s right or not. The net effect of these more minor moments of domineering behavior is that all of these men are left to do pretty much as they please, and no one stands up to them when they’re out of line because – well – they have the priesthood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you noticed that as the story moves along, as it gets darker and more intense, the women are starting to fade into the background? Why is this happening? Yes, the murders of Brenda and Erica Lafferty serve as the catalyst for the story, but not as is focal point. I sincerely hope that someone will soon write a book and/or create a show that focuses on Brenda’s life rather than on her death. But that is not what’s happening in <em>Banner,</em> and it’s not what was happening in the book that inspired the TV series, either. The TV series is focused on examining the theological and cultural history of the emphatically patriarchal Mormon church over time, and the ways that historical legacy created a violence-tolerant cultural environment in Utah County in 1984 (and, by extension, the church as it exists today). From the outset, it is clear that women will play supporting roles in the show – the story line centers on the spiritual epiphany and accelerated deconstruction of a “typical” mainstream Mormon male. Viewers who tune in hoping to see a story that centers on Brenda Lafferty are likely to be frustrated that her voice, her presence, in this story is marginalized. From a storytelling perspective, though, <em>that’s the entire point</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brenda came from a forward-thinking family: her parents were both well-educated and working in professional careers. Brenda had been raised to be self-directing and aspirational, at least to the extent she could make that work within the framework of her family’s LDS belief system:  regardless of whatever personal goals or desires she may have had, her faith still required her to marry within the church and adhere to its doctrinal demands if she wanted to secure her own salvation. Still, although she was accustomed to a family dynamic in which she was important, in which her thoughts and feelings were important, she was also raised in a church community where deference to male authority was not just typical but expected. She went to BYU to get away from the “party atmosphere” of the local colleges in Idaho. She was enamored not just with Allen Lafferty, but also with his “Mormon royalty” family – they fit the familiar Mormon mold with which she was so familiar. Her parents had created an environment in which Brenda could thrive, so it was not unreasonable for her to expect the same from the family she married into, because they also were faithful members of the LDS church. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where the disconnect occurred: Brenda expected the Lafferty family dynamic to be similar to her own. Meanwhile, the Laffertys expected Brenda to conform to their family dynamic, regardless of her own expectations. By the time she realized those expectations didn’t line up, she was already in too deep. When she raised her voice and stated her objections, expecting to be respected as she had been in her own family, she was met with derision and hostility. Is what we see on-screen perhaps more pronounced than what occurs in many Mormon families? Maybe. Maybe not. How often do Mormon men pull their priesthood rank in their families without a second thought? Jeb Pyre – the “good” guy in this story – uses it to get what he wants, and the Lafferty brothers do the same, only more aggressively. They use it to let Brenda know that she’s not even allowed to question Dan’s revelations and edicts lest she sound like an idiot to her new family. Even Brenda’s own father presumed to have the final say about Brenda’s desire to leave Idaho to go to BYU. He relented pretty quickly, but he still felt the need to remind everyone that he was the decider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the brothers shifted their focus, the Laffertys were apparently not much of an aberration from what could be considered typical for Mormons of the time. Ammon Lafferty, even with his violently controlling tendencies, was considered acceptable in his religious devotion to the point that he and his wife were called to serve a mission for the church. Yes, the brothers shifted from being covert practitioners of unrighteous dominion to being overt and threatening authoritarians, but they were, first and foremost, products of the home, church, and community environment in which they were nurtured. That left Brenda highly vulnerable to the power structure she married into. Much the same thing has happened to many women in similar circumstances, for similar reasons. Don’t believe me? Read on.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In the short time since the first episodes dropped on Hulu, I’ve had many friends tell me that they can’t watch the show because of the intense impact they experienced from learning about the Lafferty murders in 1984. I’ve heard this from so many, in fact, that I’ve lost count. Almost  without exception, these are LDS or former LDS women who are near my age, i.e., near Brenda Lafferty’s age, who at that time were living in Utah County and/or attending BYU, and trying to carve meaningful lives out of a seemingly happy but restrictive set of rules and expectations. They’ve mentioned having been very frightened about what the Lafferty murders might mean for the Mormon community in general. They were afraid of being targeted by seemingly faithful Mormon men with hidden agendas, afraid of being condemned by church leaders for being unworthy due to noncompliance, afraid of being judged and chastised by peers and Relief Society overseers at church, afraid of their husbands or sons sliding into the kind of scrupulous-turned-extremist thinking and behavior that the Lafferty family experienced as part of their “normal,” afraid of being trapped in marriages to angry or power-hungry men that they couldn’t escape from, afraid of what would happen to them and/or their kids if they <em>did</em> try to escape, afraid for their eternal salvation and their eternal ties to their families if they walked away from a dangerous marriage. These are not unfounded fears, but rather fears born of experience observing what happens when women try to claim their autonomy within a high-demand religious culture.</li><li>Conversely, I’m also seeing numerous posts from people who are frustrated by the way the story is framed in the UTBOH series because they feel the fictionalization detracts from the authenticity of the depiction of Mormons (either mainstream or fundamentalist), or because their own lived experience within Mormonism doesn’t fully align with what they’re seeing on-screen. Whenever I see  “Nobody does that” or “Mormons aren’t like that” comments,  I take a deep breath and instead ask myself “What are they really reacting to? What are they seeing that makes them so uncomfortable that they want to discredit this story on its face?” And I have a theory. It goes like this:<ul><li>As Mormons, we are taught that salvation is dependent not just on grace, but on our commitment to achieving “perfection” as it is defined within Mormon theology. Even though we know intellectually that perfection isn’t really possible, we are told to always be striving to hit certain marks, to never cease in our efforts, to endure to the end. We are held – and hold ourselves and each other – to impossible standards, and go to great efforts to show our compliance with the perfection mandate by doing and saying and looking as much like “good Mormons” as we can manage. The definition of “good Mormon” may vary a bit from one congregation to the next, but there’s always the highly visible general church leadership to refer to as the approved model.</li></ul><ul><li>Part of compliance is to call out deviations from the norm as “falling short” in an effort to inspire people to do better, try harder, to “be ye therefore [more] perfect” than they were yesterday, or five minutes ago.</li></ul><ul><li>So, since calling-out is part of the thing we were taught to do to help each other on the path to perfection, we get used to doing it even in situations where individual experiences and perceptions will vary because that’s how humans are. When we see something that we are used to interpreting as a social marker (aka a virtue signal), and it doesn’t match what we believe should be the “correct” expression of that, then we become uncomfortable because it calls our own understanding into question.</li></ul><ul><li>It’s easy to engage in this unwarranted judgment of our peers even after we’ve distanced ourselves from a religion that doesn’t serve our needs any longer. The human need to protect the legitimacy of our own narrative overrides our understanding that there is no one-size-fits-all path through life, even when we are intellectually aware that we’ve been programmed to respond to certain situations in specific ways that would have us deny our own truth.</li></ul><ul><li>The net effect of this programming is that when we encounter things like dialogue or social behaviors that don’t strictly align with our own experiences in similar situations, our first inclination is to say something like “that’s not accurate” or “who does that – nobody does that” rather than remembering that no two Mormons experience the church or practice their faith in exactly the same way. When we see something on-screen that doesn’t match our own carefully constructed worldview, we can become uncomfortable because – OMG – the rest of the world will see it too, and we don’t want the world to misunderstand who we are or what we believe. Even if we’ve stepped away from orthodox belief, those defenses can flare up in a case of “don’t make fun of my people; if anyone is going to pick on them, it should be me.”</li></ul></li><li>Lastly, back to the question of whether DLB should be telling Brenda Lafferty’s story at all, and whether he’s diminished her voice by making the focus of the series yet another white Mormon male. Here’s my thinking (that’s what you’re here for, yes?):<ul><li>Brenda Lafferty’s story, told from her point of view, is a story I would very much like to see. She deserves that. The greatest tragedy in all of this is that her life was cut short before she had the opportunity to chase her dreams, to change her little corner of the world for the better, to tell her own story. In fact, that was the very reason, when you boil it all down, that Ron Lafferty wanted her silenced. He didn’t want anyone to hear anything she had to say, ever. His alleged revelation – yet another self-serving manifestation of a frustrated, entitled, man who was promised everything – sprang from his desire for vindication, for vengeance, for all the slights and disappointments he had suffered. He projected his anger at his brother’s wife, Brenda. She was easily accessible and vulnerable, in a much weaker position than he was, and he manipulated a lot of other people to help him accomplish his objectives. There’s no doubt in my mind that if he had been able to get to Dianna (and maybe the kids, too), he would have considered her life forfeit as well.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, losing Brenda’s voice makes telling her story from her own perspective a daunting task, especially if you want to avoid fictionalization. Brenda’s sister has done heroic work to preserve and honor her memory and the memory of baby Erica, and their story deserves to be documented and told as far and wide as possible. But…</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>DLB has made it clear that his focus for this story is to call out the misogynistic patriarchy that created the culture that allowed and enabled the Lafferty brothers to become Brenda’s murderers. Clearly Brenda sensed danger – she tried to do what she could to keep her family safe from it – and she became a target for her efforts. She’s neither the first nor the last Mormon woman to die because she was considered a threat to the power of the men around her. That is the point, really. DLB talks about his motivations for presenting the story the way he does, including his awareness that women in the church have historically been marginalized, disenfranchised, and disempowered, even while being pedestalized and told their participation in god’s divine plan is essential. Since Brenda can’t speak for herself, presenting the story from Jeb’s perspective instead allows us to see his dawning realization that not only is his knowledge of his own faith naïve, but also that the church’s history and influence on its members has not always been good or even merely benign. He starts to see that he has been unwittingly contributing to the harm. It’s only a matter of time before his proverbial shelf breaks.</li></ul>\n",

New hair color and a little bit of hair treatment. The feeling was superb. I felt happy when I looked at my new me in the mirror. Me, myself, and I are smiling back at me! It felt like, they were cheering and rooting for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I woke up inspired. I feel like I can take on anything. I asked my husband to join me in a quick stroll at the mall. You can call it a date if you want. Simple talks. Just the two of us. Funny that our conversation is also growing old. I loved that we were able to spend some alone time together. Before we go home, I bought myself a pair of sandals. By the way, that new pair of sandals is not in my plan. Can I add it to “self-love ” too? Lol!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My weekend is just the same.

        "content": "\n<p>Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has condemned the conspiratory silence for over 24 hours of President Muhammadu Buhari over the brutal hacking to death of a 200 level Christian student of the Sokoto College of Education, Miss Deborah Samuel Yakubu, by Islamic extremists in the school over alleged blasphemy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HURIWA warned that reprisals may become inevitable if the case of murder of Deborah in Sokoto is swept under the carpets like similar cases of murders of Christians over alleged blasphemy by Islamists in Kubwa, Abuja, and twice in Kano State.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rights group told Sokoto State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal and the hierarchy of the ill-fated school that the blood of the innocent Christian girl murdered in broad daylight is on their heads and generations unborn won’t forgive them for their seemingly ominous inaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HURIWA said it is urging that the strongest deterrent action provided by law is applied against the killers of Deborah who are even captured on video recordings or else the Federal Government has unwittingly authorised that reprisals should occur and the violence will do Nigeria no good because religious violence could lead to a civil war.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“HURIWA is very much aware, that President Muhammadu Buhari did not mince words to condemn Indigenous Peoples of Biafra(IPOB) even without any scientific evidence linking them remotely or otherwise to the gruesome and despicable beheading of the soldiers’ couple massacred by unknown gunmen reportedly on their way to a traditional wedding in the South East of Nigeria. President Muhammadu Buhari even gave an order that the killers be hunted down and dealt with decisively by military forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“President Muhammadu Buhari did this aforementioned hurriedly but generally hasty reaction because the perceived or suspected killers are Igbos, an ethnicity that his administration has treated with the short end of the stick for not voting for him in 2015 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“But since over 28 hours that a Christian student of the Sokoto College of Education, Deborah Samuel Yakubu, was lynched by Islamic students for alleged blasphemy, President Muhammadu Buhari has maintained conspiratorial silence as if the innocent blood that was shed by the extremists is not that of a human being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This same hypocrisy of conspiratorial silence was noticed with the Sokoto State governor who stayed away from taking action but secretly sent his commissioner for higher education to speak on the murder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We in HURIWA want to let him Tambuwal and Buhari know that so long as there is no justice for this murdered Martyr Miss Deborah Yakubu, her innocent blood is on their heads”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HURIWA condemned the management of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto for standing by and for doing next to nothing whilst the riotous Islamic extremists within the students body descended on their fellow student and killed her like a chicken but only made timid announcement of the so-called indefinite closure of the institution after a female student was reportedly killed for alleged blasphemy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HURIWA said it is preposterous that the late student, believed to be a Christian, was stoned to death and burnt just because she was reportedly said to have attributed her academic excellence to Jesus and rankled by her response, she was asked to withdraw the statement — to which she refused even as her refusal to apologise made the mob attack her and then set her body ablaze.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rights group wondered when Sokoto has become an Islamic State when section 10 of the Constitution recognises Nigeria as a SECULAR STATE whereby no RELIGION IS A STATE RELIGION.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HURIWA, in a statement by Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko its National Coordinator, however blamed the management for not adequately providing her security by failing to call for police and military beef up but simply sacrificed the Christian student at the altar of religious extremism and hypocrisy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HURIWA said religious pluralism and freedoms have suffered organised criminal attacks since President Muhammadu Buhari who before he won election in 2015 supported the introduction of full shariah law in Northern Nigeria, became President but nobody who killed Christian has ever been known to have been punished in accordance with the law of Nigeria thus creating the impression that the laws of Nigeria are not meant to be effective in the core Moslem North.</p>\n",

Amen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matthew 6:27 – 30, Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature? So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin: and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The English dictionary explains ‘worry’ as, something or someone that disturb the peace of mind of, to be afflicted with mental agitation or distress, and something or someone that causes anxiety; a source of unhappiness. And has the following synonyms; concerned, anxious, troubled, or uneasy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matthew 6:31, Therefore do not worry, saying, “What shall we eat?” or “What shall we drink?” or ‘What shall we wear?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That emotion ‘worry’ is one of the major signs and indicators to the fact that we have crossed the line and boundary of custodian to ownership, where and when people have over-stretched themselves over and beyond their God-given roles and responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matthew 6:32, For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am of the belief and opinion that there could be at least two (2), perhaps three (3) reasons why people worry and fret about their needs and their lives;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>People do not know how much resources God has at His disposal,</li><li>People do not know how much God loves them, and</li><li>People doubt God’s willingness and desire to help, assist or/and bless them.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PRAYER</strong>: Oh God! Help me see, know and understand You and Your love for me, in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can subscribe to this devotional via Telegram channel at, <a href=\"https://t.me/discipleship_series\">https://t.me/discipleship_series</a>, or by following my blog, <a href=\"https://delateur.wordpress.com/category/religion/\">https://delateur.wordpress.com/category/religion/</a></p>\n",

The chef himself, Dawid came out and introduced himself and was so attentive. It was a pleasure to meet him and we wish all chefs were like him! It’s the little things that make customers want to come back and him introducing himself and checking we were happy is definitely one!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img

The menu was very unique but also had your typical Scottish breakfasts which my husband had and loved every bit. We had Arran as our waiter both nights and one morning and he made us feel like we had known him for years! Very approachable and easy to chat too. He also remembered our favourite drinks which we were impressed with as there were lots of other customers!￼</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"520\"

happened. Our son who is 4 told us he wants to be a chef when he grows up and what did the hotel do? Make that happen! Dawid and Lauren the chefs, set up a little station for him with his own special chef hat and jacket and let him do some of the hard work! I can’t believe they done something like this and they will never know how much something so little has done for us as a family. I hope our son will always remember it. After our son had his special cooking session, we enjoyed a gorgeous afternoon tea with the food he made himself along with some other sandwiches, pastries and sweets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        "content": "\n<p>Beth and I were eating at Olive Garden one evening.  It was just a few hours of “us time” that we took advantage of (for once….) and enjoyed ourselves.  Beth happened to notice an elderly gentlemen who was sitting behind me/over my right shoulder, out of line of sight (without being obvious and twisting around asking “Where!?  Where!?…”) eating dinner by himself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years back we were heading out to see family, stopping at a Denny’s along the way to grab dinner ahead of time.  It was no special occasion, we had all four children with us at the time, and with nothing else in the area, settled on Denny’s that night.  We sat down, ordered and began to enjoy our meal and visiting together.  When time came for the check we were informed that someone else had paid our bill that evening.  The wait staff referred to a gentlemen who noticed our family and asked for our bill to be added to his.  We were told that even the tip was covered that night.  We looked around but but discovered that he had already paid his/our bill and had left the restaurant.  We could not even thank him for his unexpected act of generosity.  Our could we?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Beth and I sat and visited, discussed the day, errands to do while we were out and about we could help but think about the elderly gentlemen sitting by himself just a few steps away.  Who was he?  Was he single, married, a widower?  Why was he dining alone this evening?  Was he traveling, on business, out running errands as we were?  Beth smiled, leaned in to me, and said, “Lets cover his bill tonight?  Do you remember that time at Denny’s when…..”  Yes, I quickly agreed.  Lets do that.  We can never repay the man who ‘made our evening’ and treated us six to dinner that night (no small total, even at Denny’s let me tell you…) but we can ‘pay it forward’.

We knew how he felt all too well.  “Someone noticed me and covered my bill tonight”  Where was he going?  Who was he going to see?  We never knew, but we knew we made a small difference in his life that evening.  Someone covered his meal.  Someone paid his debt.  Someone sent him on his way home (?) with no cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone covered our bill a long, long time ago.  They paid a debt that we could never, in a 1,000 lifetimes, ever repay.  We can not even begin to think about how we could do that.  And we really shouldn’t bother.  What we should be doing is looking for more opportunities to “pay it forward”.  To show compassion on those around us who need to know that someone noticed them.  Someone saw their need, however small, and decided to do something about it.  Pay it forward; its a great feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For “<strong>whatsoever you do to the least of your brothers and sisters, you do unto me,” says the Lord Jesus</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Mark Levigne lives with his wife Beth and three wonderful kids Katie, Aaron and Stephen, in Medina, Ohio.  By trade he is a singer, musician, song writer, worship leader, and actor, and is a proud Air Force dad of Matt who is stationed overseas.  To pay the bills he is an IT guy at a really nice company in Akron.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you liked what I had to say, please LIKE it and feel free to leave a reply.  Thank you!</p>\n",

Often if we just go with the flow, although there’s a certain relaxing element to it, we can lose sight of our days, our weeks, and time can easily slip away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been wanting to go to the Dandenong Ranges for ages now. I’m always reminded of it in Autumn, one of the most beautiful times of the year… especially for a place with so many trees and variety of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We scheduled it in, and it finally happened today.

On arrival, our nine-year-old grandson, Alex, sprinting toward us at top speed and greeting us with great big hugs was a boost to our jet-lagged spirits. Alex was our guide for the final leg of our journey, a short tram ride to his new neighbourhood (while his parents, who were also there to greet us, returned home on their bicycles). When we were settled in, Kyle and Alex took us for a short walk to see a little of their pretty neighbourhood and its green spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"15287\" data-permalink=\"http://lifephasenext.com/20220503_171318/\" data-orig-file=\"https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,900\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.8","credit":"","camera":"SM-S901W","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"5.4","iso":"20","shutter_speed":"0.0061728395061728","title":"","orientation":"1","latitude":"52.0845046","longitude":"4.351222899729"}\" data-image-title=\"20220503_171318\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg?w=736\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-15287\" srcset=\"https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg?w=736 736w, https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg?w=150 150w, https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg?w=300 300w, https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg?w=768 768w, https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://lifephasenext.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/20220503_171318.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>An introductory walk in the neighbourhood and our first historic windmill</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Alex on the last few days of his spring school holiday, we were able to spend the day with him while his parents worked and ran errands. It was so cool to have him lead us around his neighbourhood, showing us his school, the shopping street, and his favourite parks with such joy and confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Our first venture out of Western Canada where masks are still commonplace (though mostly no longer mandated) has felt a little surreal. Grocery stores, trains, and festivals with no masks in sight. Life feels so normal, until I remember that it still is not. </p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>May 4 is Remembrance Day in the Netherlands (we hadn’t realized), where civilians and soldiers who have died since the outbreak of World War II are honoured with half-mast flags, ceremonies and two minutes of silence. It is always followed by Liberation Day on May 5, which celebrates when the Netherlands was liberated from German occupation and flags are raised again. Oddly, Liberation Day is only an official holiday every five years (next in 2025), but Kyle had the day off so we were all free to head into town for our first glimpse of the city. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure

Bicycles even form part of the NS train system, and can be picked up at a station for the final ride to work or home, kept for the day or night, and returned to the station within 24 hours. Our <em>anonymous</em> OV-chipkaart train cards (no photo, no ID required) don’t allow access to these bikes, but there were other short-term bike options. We chose <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.htm.nl/en/about-us/our-transport/htm-bike\" target=\"_blank\">HTM fiets</a>, part of the tram system, and were able to locate bikes not far from home.

        "content": "\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick and great trip out west to Tucson which was amazing.  We love Tucson and the resort we stay at, the landscape, the food, the sun, and the heat.  Here is a short recap of our trip which started out with our flights being canceled out of O’Hare and we were 1 hour from leaving to drive up to the airport.  Talk about a frustrating experience that seems more and more common now.  We got a full refund on our flight (not a voucher, I would not take a voucher) and we were able to book flights out of Indianapolis that left an hour earlier and returned about 12 hours later than what we had previously booked.  The flights cost us more, but it worked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We rushed to Indianapolis caught the flight and flew into Phoenix and then drove about 1.5 hours to Tucson.  Tucson is a great city!  Surrounded on two sides by the Saguaro National Park, the area is filled with bike trails, hiking, parks, great restaurants, and lots of outdoor activities.  The saguaro cactus (which is the large, tall, traditional-looking cactuses) line the roads, landscape, parks, and mountains.  The sunsets are amazing, and the sky is always blue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wyndham Grand Resort is a wonderful place to stay and provides a lot of great views of the mountains.  It consists of suites, multiple pools, a tennis club, horseback riding, a great workout facility, a restaurant, live music at night, trails, and many other amenities.     </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are hoping to take the kids in the future.  The heat will challenge us all (76 degrees by 6 am in the morning and 98 by 10 am) but such a beautiful yet harsh landscape filled with life.  The kids have not seen a saguaro cactus in person (they have in botanical gardens) but to see thousands of them is awesome.  To look at them up close and see how old they are, and to understand their strength and resilience to the dry, hot weather is pretty amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon return, it happened to jump from maybe 1 week of spring straight to summer.  Welcome to Indiana… Excited to be home but we can’t wait to go back! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure

Set against the backdrop of Ireland slowly working towards peace between Catholics and Protestants, North and South, the five find themselves time and time again in ridiculous situations that are all too relatable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">I recently read an article about the show which claimed what made it so captivating was that the stakes are so low. No matter what the girls (and James) do, it has no real significance or impact on the world. I know this was meant in a complementary way, but I can’t help feeling that this is entirely backwards and incredibly belittling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">From my viewing, every episode has set the stakes higher and higher tackling massive topics such as LGBTQ+ attitudes in the 90s, gender stereotypes, war and politics, religion, family relationships, friendships, love, identity, wealth, and how old is too old for ‘Rock the Boat’. These aren’t small subplots, briefly mentioned before returning to a comedic teenage coming of age show, but right at the heart of each episode. These are topics that still hold huge significance now, possibly not often associated with teenage girls for fear of minimising their complexity. If these don’t set the stakes high, I can’t imagine what will except for transferring these themes into a programme with less … teenage girls. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/images/library/comedies/900x450_eps/d/derry_girls_0102.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/derry_girls/episodes/1/2/\">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">I think this is why the comment comes across as belittling – because we know these themes are important as we are constantly discussing them and seeing them in our arts, work, and culture. Yet they seem to be mutually exclusive to things that teenagers deem important. Lisa McGee, the director, shows this is not the case at all by presenting how these themes impact the Derry girls throughout every aspect of their lives. The themes are important to the girls too – they don’t laugh them off but take them seriously, over-thinking and analysing them from every angle. We need to stop underestimating teenagers and their priorities, labelling them as ‘low stakes’, because in many ways teenagers share ‘adult’ priorities but respond to them in more exaggerated and honest ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">The individual characters are also amazing and so true to what teenagers are like. I feel like I knew all five of the girls during secondary school and even the adults have personalities that I see in people around me. They aren’t caricatures or overly exaggerated, which adds to the honesty and authenticity of the show. With friends, I have easily assigned different roles to people we know, recognising their inner Jenny Joyce or Aunt Sarah ditziness. The humour is funny because I feel like I’ve experienced those conversations myself, whether as one of the participants in it or as an onlooker. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1034\" data-permalink=\"https://rebekahthebacon.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/teenagers-troubles-and-irish-accents/image-11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png\" data-orig-size=\"640,320\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=640\" src=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=640\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1034\" srcset=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png 640w, https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=150 150w, https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image.png?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/tara+lynne+o'neill\">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">As much as the girls (and James) are the centre of the show, that doesn’t take away from the character development and depth given to other periphery characters. By watching the show we learn so much about the mothers, coming to love them in their own right as much as Uncle Colm, Father Peter, Sister Micheal, and Tina O’Connell. This paints a picture of the wide variety of people in Derry, whilst recognising in life it’s always the same people cropping up. Lisa McGee pays tribute to this somewhat by taking us into the school years of the mothers, showing how the people around us influence and shape our histories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">The final reason why I love Derry girls that I will mention is because of all the men. Fairly regularly within the series, the scene is built up to present a man as a heartthrob, someone desirable and utterly irresistible. In every single one of these cases, the man has been the most generic representation of a man possible. There are no rippling abs, sharp cheekbones or anything particularly out of the ordinary. The men look like the sort of men you are likely to have come in to fix the boiler or to meet in a service station. It’s the kickback at media representations that people have to look a certain way to be attractive because, as in real life, most people don’t look like the posters. In fact, we don’t want people to look like the posters – we want people who are real. Attractiveness is entirely defined by the viewer and we are all viewers. Sometimes all that requires is someone doing house maintenance just after you’ve read a steamy chapter about Heathcliff. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1036\" data-permalink=\"https://rebekahthebacon.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/teenagers-troubles-and-irish-accents/image-1-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"540,335\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"image-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png?w=540\" src=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png?w=540\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1036\" srcset=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png 540w, https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png?w=150 150w, https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-1.png?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.tumgir.com/tag/father%20peter\">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">I don’t necessarily think Derry Girls is underrated, that’s not why I’m writing this. Instead, I know it is an incredible show and many people enjoy it. But I think it manages to do something few other TV shows are doing. It shows the comedy of real life as it is, with all of the serious and important parts of life, with people who look like those we see every day and act like them too. The show represents teenagers and their resilience, taking us alongside them as they live through historic moments in Ireland’s reconciliation. If you haven’t watched it, you need to change that and if you have, you need to watch it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"1038\" data-permalink=\"https://rebekahthebacon.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/teenagers-troubles-and-irish-accents/image-2-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png\" data-orig-size=\"750,422\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"image-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=750\" src=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=750\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1038\" srcset=\"https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png 750w, https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=150 150w, https://rebekahthebacon.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/image-2.png?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://twitter.com/channel4/status/1516519001819688980\">Image Source</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Find my top TV show recommendations <a href=\"https://rebekahthebacon.wordpress.com/2021/12/06/tv-series/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><p id=\"block-4ebfae21-b164-4f63-959f-7bde3a034966\"></p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure you are notified when future posts go live, subscribe to my blog below:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-subscriptions wp-block-jetpack-subscriptions__supports-newline\"><div class=\"jetpack_subscription_widget\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-subscriptions__container\">\n\t\t\t<form\n\t\t\t\taction=\"https://subscribe.wordpress.com\"\n\t\t\t\tmethod=\"post\"\n\t\t\t\taccept-charset=\"utf-8\"\n\t\t\t\tid=\"subscribe-blog\"\n\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p id=\"subscribe-email\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<label\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid=\"subscribe-field-label\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor=\"subscribe-field\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"screen-reader-text\"\n\t\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address:\t\t\t\t\t</label>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<input\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttype=\"email\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tname=\"email\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstyle=\"font-size: 16px; padding: 15px 23px 15px 23px; border-radius: 0px; border-width: 1px;\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tplaceholder=\"Enter your email address\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue=\"\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tid=\"subscribe-field\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/>\t\t\t\t</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p id=\"subscribe-submit\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"subscribe\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"blog_id\" value=\"5836086\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"source\" value=\"https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/batch?http_envelope=1&urls%5B%5D=/read/tags/humor/posts?number=40&http_envelope=1&order=desc&urls%5B%5D=/read/tags/family/posts?number=40&http_envelope=1&order=desc&urls%5B%5D=/read/tags/photography/posts?number=40&http_envelope=1&order=desc\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"sub-type\" value=\"widget\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"redirect_fragment\" value=\"subscribe-blog\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"_wpnonce\" name=\"_wpnonce\" value=\"6124dc2bdf\" />\t\t\t\t\t<button type=\"submit\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp-block-button__link\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstyle=\"font-size: 16px; padding: 15px 23px 15px 23px; margin-left: 10px; border-radius: 0px; border-width: 1px;\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t</button>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t</form>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n</div></div>\n",

I have joyful memories of cozying up with a good book and reading for hours. My husband is also an avid reader, but Audible has become our friend since life has become busier with three children, a family business, and full-time jobs. I have still longed for the day that our entire family could enjoy a good book independently. Well, today was that day, and I foresee many more in our future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to give Josiah and Serenity credit for sparking a desire in our family to read hardback books again. Josiah is our 3rd grader, and he has been working hard for the last two years to improve his reading skills. He has attended reading camps and participated in tutoring and intervention. Josiah has been striving to discover his love for reading. Intriguingly, he has found the motivation to improve his reading by reading the Bible with our family weekly. We read the Bible chapter by chapter, verse by verse, and divide the weekly reading between all readers. Josiah started out reading a few verses, and now he can split the reading more evenly with the family. He is proud of this accomplishment and always volunteers to read first. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s great that Josiah and Serenity have each other as siblings and friends because they motivate each other. Serenity is a joyful new reader that loves a challenge and learning new things. You can feel her excitement when she sounds out each word and reads each sentence. She runs home after school, ready to read and share what she has learned, and it is exciting to witness. Serenity’s excitement has sparked a desire to read in Josiah. Instead of me having to tell Josiah to read, he lines up after Serenity to read to me. He eagerly assists Serenity with any word she feels she can’t sound out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our oldest son, Caleb, benefits anytime all electronics are taken away ( I believe this is true for all teenagers today). It improves his participation with the family and his desire to do other things like reading. Today he read books about making godly choices and what it takes to be successful as an entrepreneur. I saw the sparks in his eyes, but to keep that going, I know that as parents, we will have to continue the reading days and establish reading hours and have them often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I heard each of my children express that reading increases knowledge, and they all mentioned the importance of applying the knowledge they gained. Today was a good day, and we are grateful. I purchased new books for everyone. The children read their new books and challenged themselves by reading several books from my husband’s and my bookshelf. We enjoyed hot tea and healthy snacks while we read. We assisted each other and appreciated good discussions about the contents of our books.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Black families read together.

        "content": "\n<p>Try as I might I do not understand these behavioral patterns of the family that I was both racist towards as a joke (I’m white too–i don’t rightly care about color, but I do make fun of stereotypes) and jealous of. My first instinct, the old habit, is too I wonder what the mom and dad sacrificed in order to receive complete nights of dark silent rest from before the hour of 10pm all the way to here it’s 5:30 in the morning and there’s still no sign of them getting up. But I recently learned no deals. I have been getting very imaginative about this maybe their family is the way it is because “everything changed after mom’s accident.” They seem privileged like somebody did military time or good college time or was lucky enough to get a job at a place that cared about their employees for a very very long time. and abuse never happens there. But the hard pill to swallow and that I know it’s true is it really doesn’t matter what you do in your life you can make all the right decisions and still life could turn out really bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I yelled at myself while I was alone in the bathroom yesterday I was so tired thoughts and memories of flashbacks pointed at myself in the mirror and screamed you! stop being sick! I’m so sick of this stupid shit! Reminded me of home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Larry had gotten up to find a snack as usual and I got up to go to the bathroom. as I did I was wondering what in the world stops him from reaching out and holding his wife? Then I remember the pain. Then I remember I know the wife does things first she sets the stage for Miracles. Bible told me that it was the only thing that made me feel good about having to pull all of this energy out of my own butt. If I want sex I should just touch him. A lot. Pain relieving type touch and then maybe someday … I don’t think I’m still expecting and not loving he did say If you expect sex you have a problem and it’s not like I’m feeling horny or anything, just distant. This is the area that I didn’t know what to do about the sexual energy conservation. I’ll play with sparkles for now. I should probably grab a snack with him but I have dysregulated myself with all this stupid thinking. Best thing I can do now is yoga. Breathing. Lion’s breath don’t fail me now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>9 am they’ve gotten their whole camp pulled down and they’re leaving now I don’t know what kind of wonderful things they do all day I never got the chance to meet them. they would look over when I was playing flute or drum. Sigh. Wait A second the girls are gone and just the dad and one of the boys are taking everything down in such a timely manner that there’s no possible way that they can charge them for another day like they’ve done to us at every hotel we stayed at. Talk about trust with each other and talk about relying on each other. I bet the mom is mentally with it and presently there I bet that’s the only reason actually let’s get down to what I really think. Enough dysregulation about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really think that they are privileged and I really think that privilege comes from some hereditary, and learned abolishment of abuse. I’m sure there’s never any abuse in their household I’m sure no one was raised with bad ideas about the world and if they were they were cast from the family. Yes I think that quote-unquote good families come from some magical place where everyone already knows how to be perfectly good and does it and those are the people that matter according to society anyway and that’s why I’m jealous of them Have I constructed this as well or is this really a thing? Are you from this type of family what is it like? Are you a unicorn?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm it’s not like I’m really looking forward to dirty sweaty gritty standing in the forest sex especially considering has been five months and I had to wonder if I was pregnant for a freaking Week. Seriously not interested. I mean yeah he’s sexy yeah I love him yeah I’m proud of him yeah he’s taking care of the family so well but really this bites and there is just no hope of intimacy at all I actually think I’m going to go masturbate because yeah it’s true I am horny but then I’m gonna cry and then I’m gonna be sad and it’s gonna be a bad day This is in my hands now I mustn’t masturbate I failed it quitting smoking yesterday can I at least not god-damned be a stupid fucking idiot? Well I’m talking to myself like this it’s not going well I need to turn it around goodbye</p>\n",

Chemo was started but caused deterioration of her other conditions. My husband, myself and our 3 children (11,9 and7) cared for her. We were given one care visit a day from the local council, until a month before her death when it was increased to 3 visits. So we carried the caring duties between us. Of course other family members came when they were able to. 2 weeks before her death she went into St Raphael’s hospice for palliative care. The final week of this my husband stayed every night with her. So in all this year so far has been difficult in all kinds of ways. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since my mother-in-law passed our local council have informed us we are unlikely to be able to remain in the home with lived with her. My husband has lived in this house for 32 years, myself 11 and my children their entire lives. The stress has been immense, especially on top of our grief. The health repercussions have been felt by all of us. We’ve spoken to everybody we can and reached a point where we can do no more without any legal dates for eviction being given to us, they say we cannot apply for succession but the reasons make no sense. We really are in no man’s land whilst planning a funeral. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as I write this we are currently clearing and packing our home, with possibly nowhere to go. We have contacted our local MP to appeal to the council on our behalf but are not holding out much hope. I’ve also had to give in and apply for Pip, due to the effect this situation has had on my chronic health conditions. So we are mourning and facing homelessness within the next few weeks… sometime life really is shit…. </p>\n",

Instead they was just renovating it and putting in place new displays for their new offerings. Now they have greatly expanded their selection of fresh meats and offers meat of a variety of qualities and from a variety of regions. I think they now have like 3 or 4 choices of each major cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can probably thank the fact that we’re so close to Switzerland for that. Since the Swiss have a much more responsible fiscal regime, which was especially evident during their handling of the Chinese virus scare, people in Switzerland have much more money to spend and they do come over to France a lot to do their grocery and other kinds of shopping.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-medium\"><a href=\"https://perjonsson.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img-20220514-0218.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"11243\" data-permalink=\"https://perjonsson.wordpress.com/2022/05/15/weekend-time-to-kill-a-cow/a-nice-slab-of-dead-cow-for-supper-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://perjonsson.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img-20220514-0218.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2580,2160\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.8","credit":"","camera":"SM-G988B","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1652557129","copyright":"","focal_length":"7","iso":"50","shutter_speed":"0.02","title":"A nice slab of dead cow for supper.","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"A nice slab of dead cow for supper.\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://perjonsson.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img-20220514-0218.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://perjonsson.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img-20220514-0218.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://perjonsson.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img-20220514-0218.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11243\" srcset=\"https://perjonsson.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img-20220514-0218.jpg?w=300 300w, https://perjonsson.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img-20220514-0218.jpg?w=600 600w, https://perjonsson.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img-20220514-0218.jpg?w=150 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I got a really nice 4 cm thick slab of <em>Cote de Boeuf</em> which I put on the barbeque and cooked really slowly for supper yesterday and served with just some fries and a tomato/onion/sweet corn salad. It was great. Really tender and Timothy was happy because he got a big bone to chew on. With around 27-28 degrees we are dining on the balcony of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After we had finished eating and cleared the table Timothy wanted to watch a movie, specifically he wanted to re-watch <a href=\"https://pgsramblings.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/pacific-rim-great-special-effects-movie-with-a-totally-ridicolous-story/\">Pacific Rim</a>. That movie really has a ridiculous, totally illogical piece of shit story but who cares? Giant robots fighting giant monsters, nuff said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, now it is Sunday. I have already done the grocery shopping for today so I’m going to have a mostly relaxing day and later this afternoon I’m going to start to complain that tomorrow is Monday.</p>\n",

The topic was Near Death Experiences (NDE’s). I will cover this in a blog one day although I am not as interested in the subject now as much as I was in my early 20’s.</p>\n<p>NDE’s are described by people who either encounter death or come very close, for example during cardiac arrest, shock, anaphylaxis or some other trauma.</p>\n<p>There are lots of theories as to what is going-on.</p>\n<p>I prefer the one which talks about the stimulation of excitatory neurones in the brain that generate complex hallucinations.</p>\n<p>The idea being, or, perhaps the associated idea, is that these experience relate to the origins of the human propensity to belief.</p>\n<p>PNI is related as it is the inter-relationship between the psyche, that is, the mind, neurology, or the white and grey matter in your head, including the peripheral nervous system (the nerves running into your eyes, fingers and toes) and, immunology, the body’s defence mechanisms.</p>\n<p>If you layer on top of this our recent and growing understanding of the human gut-microbiome, you are getting somewhere, approaching the complexity.</p>\n<p>It’s funny.</p>\n<p>I remember being fascinated by PNI back in the 90’s. There were a few articles around – this was the dawn of the internet and we didn’t have Google Scholar. I was desperate to find people to talk to about this, I even considered it something I could get into as a career.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t big in the UK and I became interested in other things, first medicine then older people.</p>\n<p>Jumping forward 15 years, I met at an event Claudius, a South African thinker-cum expert in the work of Jan Smuts, Holism, Spiral Dynamics and PNI.</p>\n<p>And now, I am thinking about this again.</p>\n<p>There is a developing field of Functional Medicine in the UK, this is doctor and other scientists who are investigating and supporting people who have symptoms that lack an obvious physical cause.</p>\n<p>For example, headaches when the brain scans, lumbar puncture and blood tests are normal, odd rashes, tingling in the fingers, unsteadiness, upset bowels and bladder that after extensive investigation look and appear to function just like everyone else’s bowels and bladder, yet they seem to work differently or at least provide the person affected with significant symptoms of pain, urgency, discomfort that other so-called ‘normals’ don’t experience.</p>\n<p>This is something I have covered before so I won’t go into the details.</p>\n<p>Here is more!</p>\n<p>I was talking with my brother yesterday.</p>\n<p>He has a hard time.</p>\n<p>He is recently retired and struggling with arthritis affecting his hip and back. He has already, in his early 60’s had his first hip replacement and is scheduled for another.</p>\n<p>This is all frustrating for my brother, as he has been very active all his life, always, running, cycling, skiing, that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>Nothing is particularly surprising about any of this and you might think it odd for me to mention him in a blog about PNI.</p>\n<p>Well, you see, despite his new hip and his old bad one and constant, severe pain that limits him and interferes with his sleep, a month ago he was off in the alps skiing. Yes, skiing.</p>\n<p>He plays a weekly game of tennis.</p>\n<p>He gets out an about on his bike.</p>\n<p>And yet, at other times he has terrible, activity-limiting arthritis.</p>\n<p>He told me when he was skiing all his pains disappeared.</p>\n<p>I reminded him of our mum.</p>\n<p>She had awful arthritis affecting both her knees.</p>\n<p>Given all her other health problems she was never fit enough for surgery and so she had to put-up with the aches and pains and limited mobility.</p>\n<p>Once a week she would attend a social in Glasgow. She loved to dance. She would dance for hours.</p>\n<p>I recall, twenty or thirty years ago my mum experiencing terrible feet pain. She found it difficult to walk. I get this as well from time to time. One day, I need to hobble, especially in the morning, other days, nothing.</p>\n<p>My mum’s foot pain just disappeared one day.</p>\n<p>We have had all the tests. There is no rheumatoid or other funny inflammatory condition, x-rays are normal and all that.</p>\n<p>Just pain sometimes and at others nothing.</p>\n<p>Very dependent on the circumstances and my mood.</p>\n<p>Not necessarily a bad, worried or anxious mood, just, <em>mood</em>. My specific demeanour on the day.</p>\n<p>I said to my brother, ‘perhaps your pain is psychosomatic’ – this another name for functional.</p>\n<p>He didn’t agree.</p>\n<p>I described my hay-fever.</p>\n<p>‘That’s caused by pollen,’ he said.</p>\n<p>And yet, I have rhinorrhoea, that is, a runny nose that can happen at any time through the year, often precipitated by changes in my mental state. Pollen can affect me, mostly not.</p>\n<p>It’s a funny old world.</p>\n<p>They say there are as many neurones in your gut as in your brain, just as there are more bacteria in your gut than in your entire body.</p>\n<p>I don’t know the specifics and these would be difficult to count, and yet, things are not as they seem.</p>\n<p>We tend to believe in a concrete world. In the West at least. What you see is what you get. Spirituality is on the wane. Religious, transcendental or mystical experiences are niche, particularly for concrete thinkers like my brother.</p>\n<p>PNI sort of addresses this.</p>\n<p>It says that our psychology – what we think, feel and imagine is dependent not only upon our neurones, the electrons zipping through clouds of fat in our bodies but our immunity, all the cell signallers, the cytokines, antibodies and cell signalling-factors that keep us health and can on occasion turn on us, as in auto-immune conditions like rheumatoid or lupus.</p>\n<p>We are the finite of our bodies and we are the infinite of our minds.</p>\n<p>We are a walking anachronism.</p>\n<p>And that explains it.</p>\n<p>That we are for the most, at least at times, inexplicable.</p>\n<p>We still don’t have enough understanding of ourselves to know what causes what and why we feel the way we do.</p>\n<p>It is fine if you can climb into <em>the flow</em>, lose yourself in the TV or football or a book, if you are stuck inside, particularly if you are trapped in your body and the only way out is to walk in circles, that is when PNI strikes, it is when a NDE is an interesting diversion. When functional becomes our everyday.</p>\n<p>Go well.</p>",

But today on my Mum’s 68th birthday (my Mum went to be with Jesus April 8th, 2014), the LORD again returned this post to me – because one of you liked it (thank you for being God’s gift!!) – and I knew I had to share it with you all again – a third time because of what just unfolded.</p>\n<p>When I looked to see what post was being liked, I was so overwhelmed. Why? Because Bettie had just eerily emailed me of something so similar unfolding for her: as God placed a rainbow before her, the first she’s seen since her move, when she so needed God’s reminder that when we are faithless, He is the God who is faithful FOR us.</p>\n<p>And then as I listened to the song I had included here, I decided to send it to a friend in Washington state, but God at the last moment brought another friend in Indiana to mind also, so I sent it to her too. What I didn’t know is that her Mama went to be with Jesus hours earlier – and now my dear friend was facing her very first night without her there, after months of caring for her elderly Mama in her own home. As Indiana slept but my friend couldn’t in her grief, the Holy Spirit compelled me in the Netherlands to send that song – showing her and me how deeply our God loves us and how PRESENT He is. Just as the song says, it is truly our Jesus who makes our faith to stand. May our God overwhelm you too today by the power of His love and the HOPE that is ours in Christ Jesus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"reblog-post\">\n<p class=\"reblog-from\"><img alt='' src='https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8a3c74af2d1ca92d62dd490b46ab448d?s=32&d=identicon&r=G' class='avatar avatar-32' height='32' width='32' /><a href=\"http://shalomaleh.com/2022/03/15/unfurling-republished/\">Shalom Aleh</a></p>\n<div class=\"reblogged-content\">\n<p>On a day of fresh loss and grief for my little family, only Jesus could have had someone visit this post and have me return to re-read it only hours before that fresh loss came. It was one of numerous ways the Spirit of God revealed His nearness to me- in advance of today’s loss, preparing my heart to see and receive His compassion for our whole family. </p>\n</p>\n<p>May it bless your hearts too, and help you to see and remember God’s nearness to you through your own loss and grief also. I bless you to see details in your past you hadn’t noticed before, whereby God’s nearness to you and your loved ones becomes even more palpable to you.

Shaking hands was very acceptable.

Even in inconvenience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How were we to navigate this? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, I got into ‘trouble’ because I just wouldn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like the Bible says, wisdom is profitable to direct. I soon learned how to manage their egos while still being true to myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I read the story of Gideon in the Bible on recently, I got my Biblical backing for this way of managing these people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The men of Ephraim had accused Gideon of not calling them to the war against the Midianites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Ephraimites said to him, “Why have you done such a thing to us? You did not summon us when you went to fight the Midianites!” They argued vehemently with him.’ Judges 8:1. <br><br>Gideon’s response?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘He said to them, “Now what have I accomplished compared to you? Even Ephraim’s leftover grapes are better quality than Abiezer’s harvest! It was to you that God handed over the Midianite generals, Oreb and Zeeb! What did I accomplish to rival that?” When he said this, they calmed down.’ Judges 8:12, 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you see that he barely mentioned the thing they were angry with him for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what has grapes have to do with battles? But food has a way of calming things down, I suppose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how does this look practically?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the full blog and sign up to be the first to continue to enjoy my blogs and updates at my new website <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://learnlivewrite.com/how-to-handle-people-who-demand-defference-without-creating-bad-energy-around-you/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n",

I’ve known and loved her all her life. From then on, the clouds opened and I was pretty soppy with tears of more than gratitude as affirmations arrived by text, card, and gift. It was like a well with dried and cracked sides was being filled to the point of overflowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the weekend progressed, I started thinking of all the women in my life I have loved so much who have graced my life with their wisdom, love, friendship, kindness, and (most of all) their acceptance. On Mother’s Day, I thought about my own mother, who raised six children essentially on her own. I was the surprise and exclamation point after a seven-year hiatus. We didn’t have much, but I always knew I was loved. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1912\" data-permalink=\"http://kchamberlinwriter.com/2022/05/15/showers-of-blessings/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975/\" data-orig-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"5506,3671\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1912\" width=\"547\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg?w=547 547w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg?w=1092 1092w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg?w=150 150w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg?w=300 300w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-daria-obymaha-1683975.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Later that day we went to the family’s Mother’s Day celebration. It was hosted and organized by Christopher, our son. The men brought the food and did all the labor. (Kudos to the men in my life.) After everyone arrived, greetings were exchanged, and a commemorative photo was taken that included our amazing young women who have not yet experienced motherhood. There was plenty of sunshine, but a cold, stiff ocean breeze cut to the skin. So we gathered together outside, cozy on couches sheltered from the wind and fortified with starters and drinks.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1914\" data-permalink=\"http://kchamberlinwriter.com/2022/05/15/showers-of-blessings/girls-photo/\" data-orig-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3024,2912\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"1.6","credit":"","camera":"iPhone 12","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1652014568","copyright":"","focal_length":"4.2","iso":"50","shutter_speed":"0.00035498757543486","title":"","orientation":"1","latitude":"34.159005555556","longitude":"-118.96313611111"}\" data-image-title=\"girls-photo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1914\" width=\"590\" height=\"569\" srcset=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg?w=590 590w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg?w=1180 1180w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg?w=150 150w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg?w=300 300w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/girls-photo.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We were all chatting, enjoying ourselves and catching up, a lively group from age 18 on up (since I happen to be the upper bar, we will leave the eldest shrouded in mystery). Then someone noticed all the men were inside. After a few seconds of ruminative silence, we took up where we left off. Topics ranged. Jen’s remodeled home came up, and that led to privacy with bathroom barn doors. The hosts had this type of door and little signs that read, “Come On In” and “Occupied.” We all decided to use a bathroom with a real lock—unless we had a lookout. The sisterhood has each other’s back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discussed planned and unplanned pregnancy. Then birth order came up. Those who were eldest bragged about always being the responsible child. One who was a surprise third child lamented about a conversation she had with her dad. Comparing life before and after her arrival, he complained about how inconvenient it was to have three children—from having to get a five-top table at restaurants to “It’s more work than having just one more child.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shared in a safe place, we all listened and nurtured—after all, the last is often the best (I should know). </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1916\" data-permalink=\"http://kchamberlinwriter.com/2022/05/15/showers-of-blessings/pexels-pixabay-326545/\" data-orig-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-pixabay-326545.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2461,3445\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"pexels-pixabay-326545\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-pixabay-326545.jpg?w=214\" data-large-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-pixabay-326545.jpg?w=732\" src=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-pixabay-326545.jpg?w=732\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1916\" width=\"365\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-pixabay-326545.jpg?w=365 365w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-pixabay-326545.jpg?w=730 730w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-pixabay-326545.jpg?w=107 107w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-pixabay-326545.jpg?w=214 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Two upcoming family weddings came up. We circled around cosmetic fillers and the problems with lips. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, of course, our furry families intruded. Collectively, there were five canines 2 years and under to brag and complain about. It was utterly relaxed and restorative. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the time came to open gifts—tokens of thoughtful love. But what I cherish most are the cards where handwritten messages accompany greeting-card sentiments. Tears, hand pats, and hugs accompany this ritual. These cards will be reread later and held close to our hearts.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1919\" data-permalink=\"http://kchamberlinwriter.com/2022/05/15/showers-of-blessings/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160/\" data-orig-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"5616,3744\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1919\" width=\"528\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg?w=528 528w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg?w=1056 1056w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg?w=150 150w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg?w=300 300w, https://kchamberlinwriter.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/pexels-george-dolgikh-giftpunditscom-2072160.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So where were the men? They joined us as we opened gifts, gathering on one edge of the patio like a Greek chorus. But this chorus was not accompanying the main show. They were all engaged in their own production. We later found out they had been torn away from a ball game. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was all good! Because this writing is about all the <em>women</em> who have enriched my life in so many ways and how suddenly it came into focus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you all, my beautiful sisterhood, for the texts, bouquets, gifts, and heartful written words.

Being with relatives gives me so much anxiety.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So my phone has 7% charge left when I starting to write my first ever blog. Today is Sunday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see from the title. I hate being with my relatives(family in general). I think it’s not really a good thing. Because everyone else seems to be just fine when I sweat so much in family occasions. I don’t like it very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not like my relatives are annoying. I don’t think of them as untolerable creatures I want to avoid. In fact, I don’t hate them at all. I just hate being with them. I hate how it makes me feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the situation has been getting worse since childhood. I have always been so awkward around them. Maybe I unintentionally disrespected them sometimes too. Now, they hate me. They say, “she’s so weird” in front of my face so many times. So now it’s even harder for me to interact with them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have this cousin, he’s one year older than me. Next Sunday is his birthday. And all of my family members are supposed to go. I don’t want to go. Not because I don’t like them or I want to disrespect them, but because I know that if I go, I will feel so awkward for no reason and I will hate being there and think that it’s better to unexist. Thoughts like this creep me out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I guess I will have to attend his birthday party  anyway. Oh wait, my phone is dying. It has 1% charge now. I’ll write more later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be thinking “why would I read your blog?”  You don’t have to. I will just write random things on here, share stuff that I don’t share with anyone, or something that crossed my mind during physics class, or while watching pride and Prejudice. If you want to listen you can read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> 🙂</p>\n",

I would then export to Lightroom for some minor adjustments. Note that the photo were rendered out at sRGB in order to keep the color looking the same during export. Using Pro Photo RGB was showing the images washed out and using sRGB rendered in its right color space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adapter on the camera is Fotodiox Canon EOS to Sony Emount. They make great adapters for a wide range of cameras. I highly recommend them if you are looking to mix and match lenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any questions regarding the settings or are interested in the gear I used here, you can visit the camera gear listings below.

We are thankful that the prognosis is good – inasmuch as there is no need for surgery – but healing is just going to take too long, and requires her to stay off her feet, and there’s not a thing we can do to alter this tedious timeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at 7:30, rather than jumping in the car and driving over for Early Light worship, I took my first cup of coffee out onto the deck and looked out over this lovely, peaceful neighborhood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My personal devotional thoughts sounded something like this: <em>There are a lot of “whys” I don’t understand, Lord, and I would be lying if I said we weren’t frustrated and sad this morning. Regardless, I am grateful for this beautiful new day, and seeing the sunlight pass through the millions of leaves gives me joy and a feeling of deep peace. There is so much around me to be thankful for. There is so much of life that is good.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We plan to join our <em>Hudson Memorial Presbyterian Church</em> family for livestream worship at 10:30. Public worship, together in the context of community, is vitally important. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my heart had already turned to worship first thing today, and God’s love, majesty, faithfulness, light, grace, and goodness have been front and center since that first sip of coffee, out on the deck, where everything else becomes framed in terms of our fundamental calling to “Love God and to enjoy God forever.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Enjoy this beautiful May Sunday – DEREK</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<div

An <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/facts/atlantic-horseshoe-crab\">Atlantic Horseshoe Crab</a>. Flat on its back. Nothing delicate or beautiful about this alien-looking thing. I’m sure its Mother loved it.</p>\n<p>Its Telson was slapping back and forth. (Telson = Tail.  And of course I didn’t know that it was called a Telson. Googled it.) Creature was caught way up on the beach, tide shot out, and here we are. <em>In Deep Shit</em>. And you thought you were having a bad day?</p>\n<p>I’m staring at the Telson (<em>and yes, I’m going to keep repeating Telson like some career Marine Biologist)…</em>and I’m wondering if its Telson carries electrical current. Or like a skunk, backs up its ass and spews sulfuric sh*t all over my camera gear.  Or like a Cephalopod, shoots ink all over me, seeping into my skin, and poisons me.</p>\n<p>Stamford Daily reports: “<em>Idiot found dead on Cove Island Beach trying to save Horseshoe Crab. Good News though, his death wasn’t for naught. It was notable that he was found flat on his back, like the Horseshoe Crab he was trying to save – – his mouth wide open, teeth blackened with Cephalopod ink, with his arms straight up in the air, because no matter what, the camera gear needed to remain undamaged.</em>”</p>\n<p>Per <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/facts/atlantic-horseshoe-crab\">NatGeo</a>, Horseshoe Crabs have been around for 450 million years. And here I am, Human, around an eye twitch of that time, trying to assess the probability of being electrocuted or poisoned.  I could have pulled out my smartphone and Googled it to be sure…but <em>this</em> gives you a full measure of <em>this</em> man…<em>not a lot of depth, prefers to let the mystery of life and its currents drag him along to the finish. And ‘hopefully’ that Finish isn’t this morning.</em></p>\n<p>So, there I am. Staring down on Horsey.  His limbs and Telson desperately seeking salvation.</p>\n<p><em>Do the right thing?</em></p>\n<p><em>Save yourself?</em></p>\n<p><em>Who’s going to know?</em></p>\n<p><em>Just keep walking.</em></p>\n<p><em>It’s been such a nice, quiet, Sunday morning walk.

        "content": "\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I haven’t used my TTArtisan 7.5mm fisheye lens enough over the last few months, and it’s not because I don’t like it. I really do love the lens, how it performs and how it displays colours, contrast and sharpness. It’s because I don’t always want everything to look like a fisheye. I know it’s easy enough to convert from fisheye to rectilinear, but I haven’t been in that mindset for one simple reason which I will discuss below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I love my images to usually be one of three aspect ratios; either 3:2 or 5:4 and occasionally I will also choose 1:1 square format. Anything wider I tend to dismiss, but after a lot of thought and experimenting I think I will have to change the way I think about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">I have created three quick actions in Photoscape X Pro to convert fisheye photographs. I call them simply “Fisheye Correct 1 (Super wide)”, “Fisheye Correct 2 (Cropped straighter)” and “Fisheye Correct 3 (Wide & stretched)”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is an example of the original images:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"6234\"

After kicking off the night with some appetizers, an auction took place. Outside, fairytale lights and a photobooth kept others entertained. Finally, pizza proved the perfect antidote to the alcohol that kept flowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

In the good old days of not knowing everyone’s E-mail address, we relied on snail mail to make the initial contact and let her know when we were coming and asking if we could get together. As the day of our departure drew closer and closer, we still had not heard from her and we grew worried we would miss meeting up with her, altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At long last, I received an E-mail from Kunika, reading “Kunika is Alive”. The only mailing address we had was for her parents, who had moved not long ago. The letter had been held up, but was finally delivered. The parents let Kunika (now married and living elsewhere) know she had mail and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had arranged to meet at our hotel on this day to head off an adventure in Kamakura (separate posts) and then join Kunika and Masa for supper, back at their home. Masa was in the dentist chair in the morning, but would join us in Kamakura later in the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-attachment-id=\"754\"

So I thought it would be interesting to experience the event and to learn about this fascinating subject that seems to delight so many of my friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshop was held over 5 days, with each day offering an early morning and a late afternoon outing.  Outings were only marginally planned, to coincide with weather, wind direction and the observed arrival of birds that day and the day before.  Our workshop leader was experienced, with many decades of knowledge about birds, bird photography and this location in general.  So how did it go?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Physical fitness was not a requirement for this workshop, but every day involved walking along well sculpted and graveled pathways, while carrying a heavy camera and long lens.  That proved to be more of a challenge than I initially realized, and along with the impact of other health issues, limited my ability to stay with the group for the full duration of each day.  So please take my remaining comments in that context.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"8119\" data-permalink=\"http://oldgirlphotography.ca/2022/05/15/are-workshops-helpful/img_1693/\" data-orig-file=\"https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"4032,3024\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"2.2","credit":"","camera":"iPhone 11 Pro Max","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1652260502","copyright":"","focal_length":"2.71","iso":"40","shutter_speed":"0.0081967213114754","title":"","orientation":"1","latitude":"41.931780555556","longitude":"-82.513594444444"}\" data-image-title=\"img_1693\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg?w=1024\" src=\"https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8119\" width=\"604\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg?w=1024 1024w, https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg?w=604 604w, https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg?w=1208 1208w, https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg?w=150 150w, https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg?w=300 300w, https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/img_1693.jpeg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There seem to be two groups of individuals that attend photography workshops.  First, those who are there to learn, seek out guidance and practice what they are told.  Second, those who don’t need the instruction, are taking advantage of special access to a location or special rates for that access and/or want the camaraderie of like-minded souls.  Both are equally valid, but different, and we had that mix in our group.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"8124\" data-permalink=\"http://oldgirlphotography.ca/2022/05/15/are-workshops-helpful/64a8982-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/64a8982-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"Copyright.

Those who keenly watch their students and offer helpful advice even if not specifically asked for.  Then there are those who simply lead and let their students follow, without much explanation.  They feel their role is more to act as location guide rather than photography instructor.  I suppose these styles match up to the two groups of “students” described above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last couple of workshops I have attended have been with the latter type of instructor.  Their job was to source the experience, guide us to it then let us loose.  If we had questions, we could ask.  Some of us never did.  Some of us didn’t even really want the “group experience”, just the location or the subject.  I find it odd to pay for all the elements of the broader event and then not want to use them.  But I also find it equally odd when the instructor doesn’t bring the full experience out more.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"8129\" data-permalink=\"http://oldgirlphotography.ca/2022/05/15/are-workshops-helpful/64a9508-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/64a9508-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"Copyright.

It was something that revealed information not known before.  It was something that lead to a new idea or concept.  In the context of photography workshops, that outcome-based approach would have been (should have been?) photographs not taken before.  There should also have been time to discuss the effort, the result and to share our work with others.  In neither recent case was that the case.  Not even the offer to do so after the fact, if as stated, the light was too important to waste sitting at a computer.  I get that and support it.  But no feedback at all is not a good thing either.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"8126\" data-permalink=\"http://oldgirlphotography.ca/2022/05/15/are-workshops-helpful/64a9109-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/64a9109-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"Copyright.

The instructor gathered us together, introduced the topic, provided some general insights, answered questions, then worked individually with each of us while the others tried out a few ideas on their own.  We then all got back together at the end of the day to discuss what we had learned.  None of this happened in a classroom – it was all outdoors.  And after the fact, we could send a few images to the instructor for individual feedback.  It was a perfect design, in my view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve also run workshops myself where I first gave context and the “big-picture view” (pardon the pun), injected more background knowledge, explaining the “why” right along side the “how”.  Strangely, these have had mixed reviews, with some being very well received and appreciated, while others were labelled as too prescriptive because people just wanted to shoot.  Didn’t matter that they didn’t know how.  I guess instructors have to be ready for both kinds of clients.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"8127\" data-permalink=\"http://oldgirlphotography.ca/2022/05/15/are-workshops-helpful/64a9523-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://ninakirienkoblog.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/64a9523-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"Copyright.

But it is also true that I was able to get the same quality of shots wandering on my own (with rest breaks) as I was able to get while standing beside the instructor.  And I also got great advice from some of the people I randomly ran into, wandering just like me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rethinking the role of photography workshops in my future.  I suspect there won’t be any more, particularly if physical limitations prevent me from fully participating.  And while I fully support any talented photographer asking a fair fee for sharing their knowledge, all the scouting efforts, planning and logistics, it’s more difficult to swallow a fat fee when the experience is the one I had this last week.  So I encourage anyone who is a workshop instructor to really be clear about what they are offering, and to be a bit more honest about it in their advertising.  And maybe do some pre-work with each group, to find out what each individual might need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the experience of being in that environment last week was fantastic.  I fully plan to go back next year.</p>\n",

The Valley floor and sides, stripped free of most vegetation, can’t help but show their true colors. The most colorful place to check out these colors is along the paved one-way Artist’s Palette’s drive, which is near the Devil’s Golf Course, Gold Canyon, and Bad Water basin, other treasures of the Valley. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colors you see are the result of oxidation of various metals. One example of oxidation that everyone is familiar with is the formation of rust on iron. Along Artist’s Drive, iron compounds create the red, pink and yellow you see. Mica derived from tuff, produces the green. Manganese produces the purple. (Tuff is a light, porous rock created from volcanic ash.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://peripateticbone.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/artists-palette-2.jpeg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"32827\" data-permalink=\"http://wandering-through-time-and-place.com/2022/05/08/whos-smarter-a-mule-or-a-horse-plus-death-valleys-beautiful-20-mule-team-canyon/artists-palette-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://peripateticbone.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/artists-palette-2.jpeg\" data-orig-size=\"5472,3648\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{"aperture":"4.9","credit":"","camera":"Canon PowerShot G9 X Mark II","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1650001586","copyright":"","focal_length":"30.6","iso":"125","shutter_speed":"0.0008","title":"","orientation":"0"}\" data-image-title=\"Artist’s Palette Death Valley\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"<p>A close up of the rocks at Artist’s Palette.</p>\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://peripateticbone.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/artists-palette-2.jpeg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://peripateticbone.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/artists-palette-2.jpeg?w=1024\" src=\"https://peripateticbone.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/artists-palette-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-32827\" /></a><figcaption>A close up of the rocks at Artist’s Palette.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While visiting  the Artist’s Palette overlook is the objective, the drive itself is worth the trip.

has a full palette of colors, which one would he choose to paint a pupfish in love? Enquiring minds want to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, some background. You’ve probably heard of pupfish. There are several species scattered in locations around the National Park. Once upon a time they were happy residents of a huge lake that filled Death Valley. Lake Manly was a result of the Glacial Age. When the glaciers retreated to the far north and mountain tops 10,000 years ago, the lake was left to dry up and the pupfish were left scrambling for any remaining bits of water left, like individual springs. Lack of any contact created a number of subspecies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ones I will feature today live in Salt Creek. Their much more famous cousins live outside of the the Valley proper in what is known as Devil’s Hole, a 430 foot deep hole in the ground filled with water. What makes them so famous is that they are a critically endangered species. Today, there are less than 100 left. There were more in the 1960s but even then they were rare enough to be declared an endangered species, one of the first species to be so, seven years before the bipartisan passage of the Endangered Species Act of 1973.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Environmentalists the world over were ecstatic. The business people not so much. Nearby ranchers were limited in how much water they could pump out of the ground and developers in what land they could sell. Profits would be reduced.  All that to save a tiny fish from extinction.  A “Kill the Pupfish,” “Save the Pupfish” bumper sticker war ensued. National headlines were created and people across the country became aware of the pupfish. It is still a symbol of the ongoing battle between those who see objects primarily in terms of money and those who see them primarily in terms of inherent value.

The first thing you notice is that there is indeed a creek, which is a rare site in Death Valley. We were lucky to be there in April when it was still flowing. The second thing we noticed was that a well-built board walk followed along the creek.We eagerly set out with our eyes pealed on the water, searching.

Apparently they hadn’t received the message about being endangered. We learned that the word prolific hardly fit when describing the baby producing capacity of the females. And the males were more than willing to do their share. The literature used the word ‘millions’ when describing a season’s production. Unfortunately, when the creek dries up most of these offspring are lost. Only those that live near the spring in year around water survive— and wait for the next year so they can one again start their frenzy of propagating.
